         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall make a statement on the European Council
               which took place in Belgium on 14 and 15 December. The fight against terrorism
               remains uppermost in the minds of all the members of the European Union. There
               remains unanimous support for the military action which has been taken in Afghanistan
               and a determination to continue our efforts to root out the al-Qaeda terrorist
               network. The recent video of bin Laden demonstrates his guilt beyond any reasonable
               doubt whatever. It brought home the sheer evil of bin Laden and his followers, and
               their sick pleasure in the murders that they have committed. I do not think that
               anyone can now dispute that ridding the world of the al-Qaeda terrorist network is a
               job that is in the interests of us all.</seg>
            <seg>The European Council welcomed the Bonn agreement between the Afghan groups. It gave
               strong support for the deployment of an international security assistance force
               authorised by the United Nations Security Council, as called for by the Afghan
               parties in the Bonn agreement. The details of such a force must await the outcome of
               the meetings in Kabul between an international military team led by Major General
               McColl and the interim authorities in Afghanistan. But I can tell the House that
               Britain is willing, in principle, to lead such a force, which is likely to comprise
               troops from various countries, European and others.</seg>
            <seg>Friday's meeting of potential troop-contributing nations was attended by a number
               of EU countries as well as Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the Czech
               Republic, Jordan, Malaysia, Turkey and the United States. The British contingent is
               likely to be up to 1,000 to 1,500, though I stress that that has not yet been
               decided. We expect the resolution to be passed by the United Nations Security Council
               later this week. The United States has given its full help and support for the
               security force, and we would hope to have lead elements in place shortly.</seg>
            <seg>The force was a critical part of the agreement reached in Bonn on 5 December for
               the establishment of a provisional Government in Afghanistan. There has been a
               brilliant victory over the Taliban, who have ceased to be the Afghan Government, and
               that, of course, is a welcome liberation, but we know that that is only the start of
               enabling Afghanistan to cease being a failed state and to become a responsible
               partner in the region. The situation in Afghanistan remains fragile; the new
               political process remains in its infancy. There is, therefore, an urgent need to
               ensure that, as the war is being won, we play our part in securing the peace.</seg>
            <seg>The European Council also took stock of European security and defence policy. We
               are determined to finalise soon the EU's arrangements with NATO. That will enhance
               the EU's capability to carry out crisis management operations over the full range of
               the so-called Petersberg tasks. The European Council met amid continuing and
               appalling violence in the middle east. In our view, and that of all our partners, the
               only basis for durable peace in the middle east is full recognition of Israel's right
               to live in peace and security, together with the establishment of a viable
               Palestinian state. The members of the European Council will continue to do all that
               they can individually and through the good offices of the Secretary-General, Javier
               Solana, to whom I pay tribute, to help create the circumstances in which the violence
               can be halted and the dialogue resumed.</seg>
            <seg>The European Council's other main purpose was to prepare for discussion on the
               future of Europe. It now looks increasingly likely that 10 new countries will join
               the European Union in 2004, and we welcome that. Their accession will contribute to
               peace, stability and prosperity in Europe—ours as well as theirs. It is obvious,
               however, that the European Union cannot, with 25 and more members, work in the same
               way, with precisely the same constitution, as it has with 15. Decision making will
               need to be streamlined, and EU laws will need increasingly to take the form of
               framework legislation, with the details of implementation left to the member
               states.</seg>
            <seg>It is already the task of the European Council to give strategic direction to the
               European Union as a whole. But carrying that strategic direction into practice will
               mean looking again at the size and role of the Commission, reviewing the workings of
               the existing presidency of the Union, which at present changes hands every six
               months, and managing the business of the various specialist councils in a more
               coherent way. That is why, at Nice a year ago, when we opened the way for
               enlargement, we also agreed that there had to be another intergovernmental conference
               in 2004, and why we are now going to set up a convention to prepare for that
               conference by detailed examination of all those issues.</seg>
            <seg>The basic agenda for the conference was of course agreed at Nice. The sort of
               questions that will need to be asked are set out in the declaration of Heads of
               Government issued at Laeken at the weekend. That declaration, which I welcome,
               acknowledges not only the contribution that the European Union has made to peace,
               stability and prosperity in all our countries, but the extent to which it has to
               deliver results to the citizens of Europe on jobs, the single market, the fight
               against crime, a safe environment and so on.</seg>
            <seg>The British view, widely shared, is that while it is right to co-operate ever more
               closely with our partners, democratic accountability is fundamentally and ultimately
               rooted in the member state. As the declaration says, what European citizens expect is
                  <quote>"more results, better responses to practical issues and not a European
                  superstate or European institutions inveigling their way into every nook and
                  cranny of life"</quote>.</seg>
            <seg>The Laeken declaration, and the convention, give us the opportunity to take a
               serious look at the division of competencies between the Union and the member states.
               For the first time in the Union's history, we shall be looking at the prospect of
               restoring some tasks to the member states. We now also have the chance to open up the
               European institutions to greater public scrutiny, and the role that we want to see
               our Parliament play in policing that process is now explicitly recognised.</seg>
            <seg>The convention, which has now been established, will be chaired by the former
               French President, Mr. Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who, when President of France, played
               an instrumental role in bringing the European Council into being. The convention will
               work for a year. Each national Parliament will have two representatives as members of
               the convention. The regions will be represented as observers and there will be ample
               opportunities for views from all sections of public opinion to be fed into the
               proceedings.</seg>
            <seg>Consultations will, of course, be held in the usual way on who the parliamentary
               representatives will be. The convention will present options to Heads of Government
               who will determine whether those options should lead to changes in the treaty. Those
               ultimate treaty changes will be made by unanimous agreement of the Governments
               concerned. In the aftermath of 11 September, the European Council welcomed the
               agreement that has been reached on a European arrest warrant. We also agreed to give
               fresh impetus to delivering our objectives on asylum and illegal immigration. That
               will mean return agreements with third countries and a new agreement on handling
               asylum seekers, including common standards on asylum procedures and reception. We
               have agreed to improve co-operation on our external border controls.</seg>
            <seg>Those are all areas where we need common action within Europe, and the strength of
               a united European approach in dealing with the rest of the world. I hope that we
               shall see agreements concluded in the coming year on all those points. Once again at
               this Council, Britain played its full part constructively and achieved the outcome it
               desired. Europe faces huge challenges ahead, as it enlarges to 25 and, over time, to
               more than 30 countries covering territory from the Atlantic to the Black sea, with
               500 million citizens in the EU. Those challenges are clear: over the completion of
               the single market with a single currency; over economic reform; over making European
               security and foreign policy work; over giving Europe the institutional framework to
               allow it to function effectively.</seg>
            <seg>Those debates matter to Europe, but they also matter fundamentally to Britain. The
               days of isolationism are gone, rightly. Our role now is to be a leading partner in
               shaping the Europe of the future, not following reluctantly the shape moulded by
               others. We are playing that role now. We will continue to do so.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#SMITH">
            <seg> </seg>
            <seg>I thank the Prime Minister for his statement on the Laeken summit and his words on
               the proposed United Nations peacekeeping force. If I may, I shall address the issues
               around peacekeeping first, as they perhaps have the most immediate significance for
               our troops.</seg>
            <seg>The Prime Minister is right to talk about the success of the coalition against the
               Taliban. Events are still going on and clearly it is too early to say that the
               coalition has been fully successful, but so far it has been a dramatic success.
               Throughout, I believe rightly, we have supported the objectives laid out by the Prime
               Minister and by the President, and we remain committed to those objectives. Our
               United States partners are cautious about deploying their troops in a peacekeeping
               role, as they think that that may be inconsistent with much of what they are doing in
               search and destroy on the ground in southern Afghanistan. The Prime Minister knows
               that I have deep misgivings about British deployment on a peacekeeping mission such
               as he described. My misgivings are based particularly on the reality that we already
               have troops on the ground with the Americans carrying out search and destroy against
               remaining elements of the Taliban and al-Qaeda. What concerns me and, I think, the
               House is that elements of the Pushtun are still unhappy about the settlement, and
               that members of the Taliban will find an opportunity to pick a target in the
               peacekeeping process to get their own back.</seg>
            <seg>We have a number of questions for the Prime Minister arising from those deep
               concerns. Will he confirm the words of his official spokesman this morning that the
               initial deployment of a stabilisation force could be in Kabul before Saturday? Will
               he confirm to the House that any hurried deployment will overlap with British forces'
               involvement in search and destroy missions, as I have described?</seg>
            <seg>Will the Prime Minister tell the House that military support—logistical support,
               airlifts and air cover—that peacekeepers will receive from the United States will be
               substantial? There are reports that a precondition for deployment was that the force
               will be under overall US command. Has that now been finalised and agreed?</seg>
            <seg>What conditions will be met before our troops are deployed? What particular exit
               strategy has been decided on? Is there a time limit for their deployment, or is that
               to be open-ended and the subject of future discussions about when it will end?</seg>
            <seg>As so many people in Afghanistan have weapons—pretty heavy-calibre weapons at
               that—what assessment has been made of the equipment necessary to protect the force?
               It may not be right to leave troops with the minimum equipment or light equipment,
               such as flak jackets and personal weapons. Heavy back-up support, even at the level
               of artillery, may be required.</seg>
            <seg>Those serious questions need to be answered; otherwise the deep misgivings that
               Conservative Members and many others have about the deployment will remain. Our
               misgivings need to be assuaged, so that we can understand more fully that our troops
               are not being put into situations that they will be completely unable to control. I
               shall now turn to the Laeken summit, about which the Prime Minister said: <quote>"I
                  believe increasingly that argument is moving in our favour."</quote> If only it
               were.</seg>
            <seg>Unfortunately for him, we can read the declaration that he signed up to. Nation
               states coming together for specific purposes can solve problems, but the declaration
               did not seem to reflect any of that. The response to 11 September was not about
               transnational institutions, but about the ability of free nation states to deal with
               specific problems. Laeken should have reflected that, and my concern is that it did
               not. </seg>
            <seg>I shall quote from the declaration: <quote>"Over the last ten years, construction
                  of a political union has begun"</quote>. Furthermore, the document asks,
                  <quote>"How can the authority and efficiency of the European Commission be
                  enhanced?"</quote> Is that really what the nations and the people of Europe have
               been crying out for: enhanced significance and power for the Commission and deeper
               political union? The declaration goes on to speak of the deepening and enhancing of
               European foreign policy. Does the Prime Minister believe, as I do, that the argument
               for a deeper foreign policy falls apart when we see how he and the United States were
               able to deal with the problems following 11 September in giving a lead to others who
               otherwise would perhaps not have been anything like as supportive? Should not that
               freedom continue rather than be sunk into a super-European concept?</seg>
            <seg>Notwithstanding the Prime Minister's words, the document discusses dismissively the
               importance of national Parliaments. It says: <quote>"The national parliaments also
                  contribute towards the legitimacy of the European project."</quote> I thought they
               were the legitimacy of anything in Europe, rather than just contributing to it.
               Again, for those at Laeken the European project came first. They go on to say that
               they <quote>"want to see Europe more involved in foreign affairs, security and
                  defence"</quote>.</seg>
            <seg>Yet again, deeper and deeper integration. These decisions, I think, characterise a
               shift towards greater central authority; but there are three particular areas in
               which the Prime Minister agreed to things that the British people would not have
               wanted had they been at the table. First, he agreed to an EU-wide arrest warrant.
               That has done away with the principle of habeas corpus in regard to no fewer than 32
               crimes, including crimes unrecognised in British law such as the ill-defined "EU
               crime"—a real thought police crime which will no doubt be drummed up in the future by
               someone in Brussels. Then there is falsification of means of payment, and, of
               particular concern, xenophobia. What exactly does that mean? <incident>
                  <desc>Laughter</desc>
               </incident> Labour Members laugh at xenophobia, but our concerns are generous. After
               all, what would have happened if crimes such as xenophobia and racism had existed
               over the past few weeks? The Prime Minister's poor Home Secretary himself might even
               now be languishing in a prison in Brussels. It is very unjust.</seg>
            <seg>Secondly, the Prime Minister cannot believe that he has moved the argument into a
               federal Europe rather than away from it in signing up to what is becoming a European
               constitution. <quote>"Towards a European constitution"</quote> are the words; it is
               not a case of whether there should be a European constitution, or whether it is
               relevant. The Prime Minister agreed to that in the declaration. I remember the Prime
               Minister saying in Warsaw last year—yes, last year: things move on— <quote>"in
                  practice I suspect that, given the sheer diversity and complexity of the EU, its
                  constitution, like the British constitution, will continue to be found in a number
                  of different treaties, laws and precedents"</quote>.</seg>
            <seg>Well, the Prime Minister seems to have caved in over that. He seems to have thrown
               that one away in the course of his agreement at the weekend. Not only has the Prime
               Minister signed up to a constitution; he has allowed the charter of fundamental
               rights to be made part of it. This is the charter that he and his colleagues assured
               us would have no more legal weight than the Beano. Is it really the charter that he
               is now allowing to go into the constitution?</seg>
            <seg>Thirdly, there is the creation of the European security and defence policy, better
               known as the Euro army. If anything is more meaningless than that, it is the fact
               that at this time, after 11 September—given the lack of any significant EU response
               to those troubles, in many senses—the Prime Minister has gone ahead and agreed to
               further and deeper powers and control over defence at a European level. That will add
               absolutely nothing to the process of defending us against the evils that exist around
               the world, and will add everything to the lessening of our ability to do so by
               weakening NATO. What a time to agree to that! What a pointless exercise.</seg>
            <seg>We witnessed an unedifying spectacle at the end. The only time the leaders gathered
               around the table became really exercised and excited was when it came to carving up
               the agencies that would go to their various countries. There were rows about what
               they would get—whether they would get enough—and disagreements over whether Parma ham
               looked better than Swedish women. That was what exercised the whole institution. How
               ridiculous! <incident>
                  <desc>Interruption</desc>
               </incident> It is all here. For the first time we have broken the code of secrecy
               applying to such debates, and can see what each leader was horse trading for. They
               were all rowing about ridiculous issues such as whether their countries should get 19
               people or 1,000.</seg>
            <seg>One issue that was never addressed was Ireland's veto over the Nice treaty. We
               still cannot go ahead with the treaty, because Ireland has rejected it. No doubt the
               Government will acquiesce in a drive to bully it into ensuring that it gets the vote
               right the second time, as ever. As the Prime Minister said, the future of Europe does
               matter: it matters immensely. The Prime Minister has agreed to the establishment of a
               convention that is supposed to involve a balance of agreement about where we are
               going on Europe. Will he now say whom he intends to put on that body, from the

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>May I deal first with the issues arising from the deployment of British troops as
               part of the peacekeeping force in Kabul? Although the questions that the right hon.
               Gentleman asks are perfectly reasonable—they are the obvious questions that we are in
               the course of answering—I very much hope that the Conservatives will support the
               deployment of British troops in the peacekeeping force, provided that those questions
               can be properly answered.</seg>
            <seg>We have been looking at undertaking the mission at the direct request not only of
               the United Nations but of the United States. Of course, we have to make sure that our
               troops go to Kabul under proper conditions; that is precisely what we are doing now.
               However, it would be very unfortunate if we walked away from the situation, having
               achieved so much, and given that the peacekeeping or security force in Kabul is vital
               in allowing the provisional Government to exist, to prosper and to start putting
               Afghanistan back on its feet. If the international community walks away from
               Afghanistan now, it will make exactly the same mistake that the west made 10 or 12
               years ago, when it left Afghanistan to become, as it did, a failed state.</seg>
            <seg>In answer to the right hon. Gentleman's points, the United States has made it clear
               that it will offer full logistical support, including air cover support. A specific
               time limit has not yet been decided, but people are talking of several months, so
               British forces would not be in the country on a long-term basis; they would simply
               get the security force going. That force will, of course, have all the equipment that
               it needs to do its job properly.</seg>
            <seg>There was talk this morning about when we can put people into place. That depends
               on the agreements being tied down, but lead elements may be in place by 22 December,
               when the provisional Government begin their work. Of course, there is no question of
               the full force being in place by 22 December; it will take far longer to put that
               together. I hope that, once those questions are answered, the right hon. Gentleman
               will give the mission his support, because it is important and because we as a nation
               are best placed to give that leadership, which is why we have been asked to do so. I
               shall deal with the right hon. Gentleman's questions about Europe in turn, if I may.
               He claims that the very talk of political union in Europe is beyond the pale. I have
               to point out to him that virtually every European treaty over the past two decades
               has talked about ever-closer union in Europe. He seems to think that there is
               something objectionable about even asking whether the Commission's power should be
               enhanced. That is one of several questions that will, of course, be raised during
               this debate. Another asks whether the European Council's power will be
               enhanced.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#SMITH">
            <seg>How?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>The right hon. Gentleman asks how. That is one of the very issues to be debated in
               the course of the work on the convention. In what I thought was a curious point, the
               right hon. Gentleman said that national Parliaments were somehow to be downgraded or
               that the claim that they merely contribute to European politics downgraded them. The
               fact is that, for the first time, Europe is looking actively at involving national
               Parliaments in the decision-making process, which is extremely important.</seg>
            <seg>I find the Conservatives' opposition to the European arrest warrant absolutely
               extraordinary. For a start, the issues raised by the right hon. Gentleman are
               included in about 30 elements that will be defined specifically when we come to
               debate the matter in the House. Basically, however, this country has everything to
               gain from the European arrest warrant. At the moment, we are seeking people abroad
               for serious crimes such as drug trafficking, organised crime and serious sexual
               offences. We have an objective need to get these people extradited quickly. At the
               moment, it takes, on average, roughly 10 months to extradite them. Some have had
               extradition warrants outstanding against them for several years. It is therefore
               vital for proper law enforcement here that we make sure that those people can be
               extradited properly.</seg>
            <seg>I do not understand the distinctions that the right hon. Gentleman was making. I
               think it a little unlikely that, in respect of xenophobia, he or anyone else is going
               to be extradited to any European country, no matter what he says. For a start, they
               probably would not want him. It is absolutely extraordinary that the Conservatives
               should say that they are against the very concept of a European constitution when we
               already have in European treaties things that are set out concerning the
               relationships between members states of the Union. Surely it is entirely sensible to
               try to codify those and bring them into a proper and disciplined method that is
               simpler and easier to understand, allowing us for the first time to look at the
               competencies between the EU and the member states. The right hon. Gentleman then went
               into his normal position on the European security and defence policy. He seemed to
               think that, somehow, agreeing to this would mean that our freedom to act as we have
               done after 11 September would be curtailed. That is the usual Conservative nonsense.
               There is absolutely nothing whatever in the European security and defence policy that
               would prevent us from acting in precisely the same way as we acted after 11
               September.</seg>

            <seg> What does it mean?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>I say to the shadow Foreign Secretary, it means this: it means that Europe should
               have the capability, if each individual country desires it to be so, to take part in
               peacekeeping operations—as we are doing now in Macedonia, in a way that is preventing
               civil war in that place and in the wider Balkans. Quite why the Conservative party
               should be against that, I do not know, but it is part of their usual European
               business. </seg>
            <seg>I do not know whether the saddest thing about the end of what the right hon.
               Gentleman said was what he said or the support that he got from his Back Benches for
               saying it. I say to the Conservative party that, at some point, it will have to come
               back to its senses on Europe. </seg>
            <seg>Let me give a classic example of what this country's diplomacy would be returned to
               were the Conservative party, in its present state, in government. There was a meeting
               of Conservative party leaders on Thursday night, which the right hon. Gentleman
               attended. One of the other Conservative leaders at the European summit described the
               meeting with the right hon. Gentleman—the first they had had—as "curious". He said
               that the right hon. Gentleman turned up for the first time with an eight-page
               letter—not written in green ink, at least—making a series of demands upon the
               European Conservative group. The right hon. Gentleman asked that those demands be
               accepted. They told him no. He asked to be able to raise them again in six months.
               They said that he could raise them as many times as he wanted. The right hon.
               Gentleman then left the meeting. </seg>
            <seg>If we went back to that method of proceeding, this country would be where we found
               it in May 1997—isolated, marginalised and without any proper influence at all. On the
               issues concerning the future of Europe—economic reform, the single market, the
               institutional future of Europe, how we create the right security and foreign policy
               for Europe in the future—Europe needs Britain to be engaged and Britain needs to have
               influence in Europe. If we went back to those days, it might satisfy some of the
               extremists in the Conservative party whose main motivation in politics now seems to
               be anti-Europeanism. But it would be a disaster for the proper interests of this
               country. I say to the right hon. Gentleman that his party will hopefully at some
               point come back to a realistic and sensible position on Europe. Until it does,
               frankly the Conservative party is barely qualified as an Opposition, never mind a
               Government. </seg>

         <u who="#KENNEDY">
            <seg>In welcoming the Prime Minister's statement and the outcome of the summit, I wish
               to point initially to the fact that too many of the European Union's detractors over
               the years have been able to make their cases precisely because it has not had an
               adequately defined constitutional settlement for the member states. The work that
               will now be undertaken on that matter is therefore to be welcomed. We will end up
               with a document that sets out what the EU should be doing and what it should not get
               involved in. Any sensible, candid friend of Europe—in this party, we are certainly
               that—would give a broad measure of welcome to such a development. </seg>
            <seg>The need for such a development is underpinned by what the Prime Minister said
               about the process of enlargement. Those of us who were Members of Parliament a decade
               or so ago and remember that Monday afternoon after the weekend the Berlin wall came
               down—and the huge sense of political liberation that accompanied it—will remember
               that all the talk was of enlargement, but a decade later, the over-ossified
               structures have not yet enabled so many of the aspirant states to join. Something
               that will assist progress in that matter is to be welcomed. </seg>
            <seg>As the Prime Minister acknowledged, that progress must also be accompanied by
               changes in our internal procedures here. Last week, the Leader of the House published
               modernisation proposals for the House to discuss. I commend to the Prime Minister an
               idea that does not appear in those proposals but on which we as a Parliament should
               reflect, and that is the need for more effective scrutiny on the Floor of the House
               of the monumental amount of legislation from Europe, which many of us have felt has
               never been adequately scrutinised. Is that something that the Prime Minister wishes
               to consider? </seg>
            <seg>It is surely welcome that more priority will be given to openness. It is a sobering
               thought that the Council of Ministers is one of only three legislatures in the entire
               world to legislate in private, the other two being Cuba and North Korea. That is not
               something that Europe should seek to emulate much longer. On Afghanistan, I wish to
               question the Prime Minister a little more about the extent of the mandate and, in
               particular, the nature of the rules of engagement for any British troops. How robust
               will the latter be? For example, will our troops be able only to defend themselves,
               or will they be proactive and able to intervene if a violation of human rights
               occurs? If our troops are committed to peacekeeping services in Afghanistan, does
               that rule out any future British involvement in, say, Iraq if the Americans decide to
               take that route? </seg>
            <seg>Could the Prime Minister modify his over-caution on the euro by giving the House a
               clearer idea of any possible time scale vis-à-vis a referendum? Does he agree that in
               opening up the institutions of Europe, and the European Council in particular, we
               should apply what we applied to ourselves some years ago, and allow those proceedings
               to be seen in public?</seg>

               anything on the single currency other than what I have said many times before. The
               tests have to be met, and that is the position. </seg>
            <seg> The UN mandate will be on a chapter 7 basis. The rules of engagement still have to
               be finalised, and they will need careful consideration to ensure that our troops are
               properly protected at all times. The Modernisation Committee will consider any
               proposals that the right hon. Gentleman wishes to submit on the scrutiny of European
               legislation. On the issue of enlargement and the simplification of the treaties, if
               the EU expanded from 15 to 25 or, in the end, to 30, it would obviously be necessary
               to simplify and change the process of decision making, which is one reason why the
               Conservative party's position is so ridiculous. That has to happen; otherwise Europe
               would be unable to take the necessary decisions. Europe is trying to codify in a
               constitution exactly what the basic competencies of member states and the European
               Union are precisely because we need the right framework to develop in future. As
               ever, the Conservative party asks completely the wrong question. The issue is not
               whether we have a constitution—we already have one through the treaty of Rome and
               other treaties. The issue is what should go into a constitution. That is where our
               main effort should be made. Rather than saying that we want nothing to do with the
               process simply because it is discussing the constitution, we should be focusing
               attention on how we manage to ensure that the constitution is drawn up in exactly the
               way that we want. We want a European Union of co-operating member states, not a
               federal superstate. The language of the Laeken declaration makes it clear that we are
               not going down the path towards a federal superstate.</seg>

               currencies. It will not be a good idea to rush into the euro. Even if he succeeds in
               deciding that we enter, at the right time, and after a referendum of the people, that

               stages. First, certain changes were agreed at Nice in relation to, for example, the

               Bonn. It will be a real shame if the Conservative party now sets its face against
               supporting such a force. Britain is talked of as the lead nation because it was
               specifically asked by both the United Nations and the United States to take on this
               role. The reason why it is important— <incident>

               for some, though not all, intensive and indeed expensive care and maintenance to

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg> </seg>
            <seg>In relation to the 10 applicant countries, the hon. Gentleman is of course right to
               say that enlargement is a very big thing to happen in the European Union. There are,
               however, phasing arrangements for many of the most critical aspects, and I think that
               that will be of some assistance. On the European Court and the completion of the
               single market, it is vital that the Court has the powers that it has and that, where
               its decisions go against particular countries, they are enforced by the
               Commission—as, for example, they will be in respect of France and the ban on British
               beef. </seg>
            <seg>As for, as it were, streamlining versus steamrollering, what is clear is that there
               are two different views on how Europe should develop. One view is that, in effect, it
               should develop into a situation in which the Commission has very much more power and
               the European Parliament is the fount of democracy in the EU—a view shared by some
               countries. There is an equally strong view—I would say now predominantly rather
               stronger—that that is not the right way for Europe to go, and that, in fact
               democratic legitimacy is rooted in the member state. That is a debate in Europe, and
               a very strongly fought one. My point is simply that the most important thing is that
               we end up ensuring that we are in Europe, fighting our corner, rather than retreating
               to the sidelines and saying that we are so scared of the debate taking place that we,
               Britain, do not believe that we can have any influence on it. In fact, we have been
               able on, for example, the issues of economic reform or European defence to secure
               many of our objectives precisely because we have been willing to be involved rather
               than marginalised. I am sure that in the end, as indeed the previous Conservative

               that the World Food Programme has estimated that as many as 3 million people may have
               been displaced because of the military action and for other reasons, and that camp
               Maslakh may be housing nearly 800,000 people in desperate circumstances. Even worse,
               in the remote rural areas, it is now being reported that some people have already
               died as a result of cold or hunger. Did the Council discuss ways to get emergency aid
               in, and will the Secretary of State for International Development make a statement on
               the position before the Christmas recess?</seg>

            <seg>I do not know the precise arrangements that the Secretary of State for
               International Development may be making, so I am afraid I cannot comment on that,
               although I will find out and let my hon. Friend know. She is right to say that
               humanitarian aid is extremely important. Of course, the only reason that we can get
               that aid through now is that the Taliban stranglehold on many parts of Afghanistan
               has been broken. </seg>
            <seg>Finally, my hon. Friend is right; we will not turn our back on Afghanistan because
               it is right to remain engaged—we promised that we would do so—and if we do not,
               Afghanistan may return to the failed state in which we found it after 11 September.
               The truth of the matter is that it was a state existing basically on terrorism and
               drugs, which subjected its people to vile oppression and was a source of instability
               in its own region and wider. For us to remain engaged in the reconstruction of
               Afghanistan is not merely right—it is manifestly in our interest. </seg>

            <seg>Will the Prime Minister confirm that the summit written conclusions and the
               declaration are littered with references to the need to cut red tape and reduce
               labour market regulation but that, simultaneously, the European Union has signed up
               to the information and consultation directive, which will add red tape and extra
               labour market regulation? How can he and the European Union be taken seriously when
               the European Union continues to say one thing in those bits of paper while
               simultaneously doing something different?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>In respect of the information and consultation directive, I do not accept that
               every single piece of European legislation is wrong. Indeed, it is not wrong in my
               view to make sure that people are properly consulted as a work force. In respect of
               the attitude of the European Union and how much it legislates and how much it does
               not, it is worth pointing out that that concern is raised in all member states. The
               European Union declaration makes it clear that that issue has to be on the agenda,
               but it is more than simply on the agenda in theory: the recent Mandelkern report was
               endorsed by European Union leaders and, if implemented, it will mean a much greater
               number of decisions at European Union level will be taken in principle but
               implemented in the way in which member states want. </seg>
            <seg>I do not dispute the fact that there is an issue and a problem but, again, the body
               of opinion in Europe is moving towards an easier and lighter-touch process rather
               than the heavy-handed regulation that perhaps we had in the past. At least the right
               hon. Gentleman has read the conclusions and the declaration, but he will find that
               many of the statements in the Laeken declaration tie in with many of people's
               legitimate fears about the encroaching power of the European Union. I therefore hope
               that, in some senses, it is welcomed by Conservative Members.</seg>

               need reassurance about a European superstate not being on the agenda? Does he accept
               that one of the best ways of providing that is to state clearly and baldly in a
               European constitution that nation states have their rights, and clearly define those
               rights and the concept of subsidiarity in the constitution? Does he not agree that
               Opposition Members do not fear a superstate or intervention in nooks and crannies as
               much they fear clarity?</seg>

            <seg>I am afraid that they are just anti-Europe. It is as simple as that. The point that
               my hon. Friend makes is true. Part of the purpose of the declaration is to make sure
               that on issues of subsidiarity, we achieve clarity. That is important. The
               declaration, which was agreed by every one of the member states, states in clear
               language that they do not want a European superstate. A few years ago, voices would
               probably have been raised in protest against that. I draw attention to the recent
               statements made in front of the French Parliament by Mr. Giscard d'Estaing on the
               same subject. There is a general view in Europe that as member states move together
               on certain matters, it is important that they decide not to go into other areas, and
               even to push back power in certain areas. That closer co-operation must be based on
               co-operation between member states, rather than on the obliteration of national
               identity.</seg>
            <seg>The idea that a country such as France has lost its national identity is absurd.
               The countries of Europe are proud of their national identity. The idea that Poland,
               for example, which wants to come into the European Union, is not proud of Poland and
               Polish national identity is absurd. We—or rather, the Conservative party—must escape
               from that ideological straitjacket; otherwise we will be unable to protect the
               British national interest, which requires us to be engaged. </seg>
            <seg>The British Conservative party is virtually alone of all Conservative parties in
               Europe in its views, so much so that the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford
               Green <note>Mr. Duncan Smith</note> must write to them pleading to be allowed a
               different set of rules from Conservative parties elsewhere in Europe. That is an
               indication of how far away the Conservative party is from a realistic view of how
               people are living and working in the Europe of today.</seg>
