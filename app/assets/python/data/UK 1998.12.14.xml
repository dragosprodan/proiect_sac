         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>With permission, Madam Speaker, I will make a statement about the meeting of the
               European Council on 11 and 12 December which I attended in Vienna along with my right
               hon. Friends the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the
               Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my right hon. Friend the Member
               for Gateshead, East and Washington, West.</seg>
            <note>Ms Quin</note>
            <seg>The Council conclusions have been placed in the Library. The Council concentrated
               on employment and economic issues, Agenda 2000, enlargement, the future development
               of Europe and a number of foreign policy questions. At Vienna - the last Council
               before the introduction of the euro by 11 member states - we confirmed and
               strengthened the strategy on economic reform and employment agreed at Amsterdam and
               Luxembourg last year and reinforced at Cardiff earlier this year. Macro-economic
               stability provides the essential basis for long-term growth. Supply-side reform must
               go hand in hand with that. Member states have now submitted national progress reports
               on the reform of product and capital markets. Those will be subject to rigorous peer
               review in the first part of next year. There will be a parallel review of national
               employment action plans, the first set of which were submitted during the UK
               presidency. At Vienna, we agreed revised employment guidelines on which next year's
               national action plans will be based. The new guidelines fully reflect British
               priorities. They place particular emphasis on tackling long-term unemployment;
               promoting equal opportunities; making a reality of lifelong learning; exploiting
               fully the potential of the service sector; creating the right climate for
               entrepreneurship; and reviewing tax and benefit systems to provide incentives for the
               unemployed to take up work or training. They promote social inclusion and examine
               regulations to ensure that they reduce barriers to employment. That work will be
               carried forward under the German presidency to produce an employment pact within the
               framework of a wider process aimed at employment, growth, stability and economic
               reform. Jobs remain Europe's top priority. The strategy developed over the last 18
               months is beginning to bear fruit, with more than 1 million new jobs created in the
               EU in the past year, including more than 250,000 in the UK, and the overall rate of
               EU unemployment falling below 10 per cent. for the first time since 1992. However,
               member states need to step up their efforts to implement real reforms in their labour
               markets, learning from one another. It was noteworthy that at Vienna representatives
               of small business people were included for the first time in the dialogue between
               Heads of Government, employers and unions. Also in the economic field, we agreed new
               measures to complete the internal market, not least in financial services; to improve
               innovation; to increase the availability of risk capital; and to strengthen
               investment in infrastructure. We agreed on the gravity of the challenge posed by the
               millennium bug and the particular need to protect national and international
               infrastructure. We also discussed the desirability of better economic policy
               co-ordination. A small part of that discussion concerned tax policy. The Council
               agreed that co-operation in that area is not aimed at achieving uniform tax rates or
               preventing fair tax competition; rather its aim is to reduce harmful distortions in
               the single market, prevent excessive losses of tax revenue and encourage
               employment-friendly tax structures. Work will continue on long-standing proposals on
               energy taxation and on taxation of savings, with a view to reaching agreement by next
               December. The UK Government will ensure that British interests - including those of
               the City of London - are fully protected and promoted in those discussions. On a
               separate tax matter, I and others called for a review of the 1991 decision to end
               duty-free sales in Europe from next year, not least since the proposed successor
               arrangements risked ridicule. The Council asked the Commission and Finance Ministers
               to examine by next March possible means of addressing the problem, including a
               limited extension of the transition arrangements. Unanimity is required to secure
               such a change, but a door that seemed firmly closed is now at least half open. The
               Council endorsed the Finance Ministers' report on external representation of the euro
               area. The UK's essential interests are protected - our membership of the G7 and other
               international forums will continue as before. We also confirmed an agenda for reform
               of the international monetary and financial system very much in line with the ideas
               for which my right hon Friend the Chancellor and I have been arguing: more
               transparency in international and national financial markets, better co-operation
               between the International Monetary Fund and other actors, and strengthened prudential
               and regulatory standards. Much of the discussion in Vienna was about Agenda 2000.
               This is a wide-ranging and important negotiation embracing the reform of the common
               agricultural policy to help the consumer, to create a more efficient and competitive
               agriculture sector and to reduce the burden to the taxpayer; and reforms to the
               structural and cohesion funds to ensure that they are fair and affordable, including
               after enlargement. On future financing, the UK is among a large group of member
               states arguing for stabilisation of expenditure at current levels by 2006. Vienna
               confirmed the political objective of reaching overall agreement at a special meeting
               of the European Council on 24 and 25 March. As for the British budget rebate, I
               repeat what I said in Vienna. The rebate is still fully justified and will remain.
               Even with it, the UK is the fifth largest net contributor in per capita terms, while
               we are ninth or 10th in terms of gross national product. We still pay far more than
               countries such as France, for example, with the equivalent population and slightly
               higher national income. On enlargement, the European Council welcomed the fact that
               the first practical results have been reached in negotiations with Cyprus, Hungary,
               Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. It also welcomed progress made by
               Romania, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Bulgaria. It welcomed the reactivation of
               Malta's application, and recognised the importance of implementing the European
               Union's strategy to prepare Turkey for membership. Work in all these areas will
               intensify next year. During the UK presidency, my right hon Friend the Deputy Prime
               Minister led work in the European Union on integrating environmental policy into
               other community policies. The Austrian presidency carried forward this work in
               transport, energy and agriculture. At Vienna, we agreed that it should be developed
               further into the spheres of international development, the internal market and
               industry. At Cardiff, I launched a debate on the future development of the European
               Union which was carried forward at the informal summit in Portschach in October. We
               agreed in Vienna further steps to make a reality of subsidiarity and improve the
               effectiveness of EU institutions. We will issue a millennium declaration setting out
               the Union's priorities for the period ahead at the end of next year, to coincide with
               a new Commission taking office. At Portschach, I urged the strengthening of the EU's
               foreign policy, not least by backing it with a credible capability for military
               action in regional crises where the US or NATO as a whole does not wish to be
               engaged. The joint declaration agreed with the French at St. Malo on 4 December gave
               us a sound basis on which to build this initiative. It was widely welcomed by
               partners at Vienna. We agreed that work should be taken forward under the German
               presidency. There is, of course, no question of undermining NATO in any way.
               Strengthening European defence capability will, I believe, strengthen NATO. On
               current foreign policy issues, we underlined the urgency of bringing the parties in
               Kosovo to a political agreement and the importance of the European Union continuing
               its political and economic support for the middle east peace process. We repeated our
               readiness to help Russia overcome its present severe difficulties, and agreed that
               Russia should be the subject of one of the first common foreign and security policy
               common strategies when the Amsterdam treaty enters into force. The Vienna Council
               also made useful progress on the economic and employment points, and above all laid a
               solid foundation for the difficult Agenda 2000 negotiations in the next three months.
               Britain's interests were safeguarded and promoted without difficulty. We defended our
               positions in a constructive way, just as others defended theirs. In the days before
               Vienna, we issued joint statements with Spain on structural reform, with Sweden on
               social policy, with France on defence and with Germany on tax. All of those were
               welcomed in the discussion and reflected in the conclusions. At Vienna itself, we
               helped shape the debate on economic and employment issues, on Agenda 2000, on
               enlargement and on other issues, in sensible directions fully consistent with our own
               national interests. This Government, I believe, have transformed Britain's relations
               with the rest of the European Union since they took office. It is in the fundamental
               interests of this country that we remain fully engaged in the debate on the
               development of the European Union. On the Government Benches, we have the confidence
               in our arguments, and in our ability to build support for them, to believe that we
               can win the debates in Europe in favour of economic reform and an open and
               decentralised Europe. Those who would end up by taking us out of Europe, or so far to
               its margins as to eclipse any serious influencein Europe, would profoundly damage
               this country. This Government will not be swayed from their positive and constructive
               European policy because I have no doubt at all that this is the right course for
               Britain's future.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#HAGUE">
            <seg>On behalf of the Opposition, may I support some of the conclusions reached at
               Vienna, including the strong commitment to the universal declaration of human rights,
               statements on the importance of the middle east peace process, work on Kosovo and the
               desire to assist Russia, Ukraine and the western Balkans? May I welcome the
               Government's efforts to retain duty free? Does the Prime Minister agree that none of
               the steps set out in the original agreement is in place, so there is an overwhelming
               case for duty free to continue? Will he tell the Secretary of State for Health that,
               as he seems to have a different policy from the rest of the Government at the moment?
               Is not the Prime Minister's habit of saying one thing to one audience in one place
               and another to an audience in another place finally catching up with him? He referred
               to the British rebate. Will he confirm that, while he was telling the British media
               that the rebate was not up for negotiation, he was busily telling the Austrian media
               that there would be wide-ranging negotiations in which the rebate would come up for
               discussion? If he did say that, did he mean it? If he did not mean it, why did he say
               it? If he did mean it, why not say the same thing in Britain? Will he cease his habit
               of saying one thing at home and something completely different abroad? Would not that
               be a much more effective way in which to ensure that his thoughts are reported
               accurately than simply whining about the British press? Nothing causes the Prime
               Minister to complain louder than the British public being told about plans for tax
               harmonisation. He made great play of the fact that the communique rules out the
               possibility of <quote>"uniform tax rates"</quote>. Apparently, that phrase was
               inserted at the Government's insistence. Why did we insist on that, when uniform tax
               rates are not the threat? Why did not the Prime Minister insist instead on an end to
               tax harmonisation? Why did he not call for the removal of references to <quote>"a tax
                  policy package", "reinforced tax policy co-operation", or the far-reaching
                  Commission "study on company taxation"</quote>? Why does not he guarantee to veto
               moves on the withholding tax or the so-called exchange of information - both and
               either of which would hit the City hard? Would not arguing against those real threats
               have demonstrated more backbone than arguing against imaginary threats? Why did the
               French and Germans point out that the wording of the communique did not rule out
               harmonisation of specific taxes? Is that what the Prime Minister agreed? Why did the
               Luxembourg Economic Minister report: <quote>"Everybody said there would be more tax
                  harmonisation"</quote>? How on earth did he get that impression? Presumably, the
               Prime Minister was there, standing up for Britain's interests. If so, why did nobody
               notice? Why did not the Luxembourg Economics Minister notice? If the Prime Minister
               was prepared to say in Vienna that there would be more tax harmonisation, why will he
               not say that in Britain? Why will he not tell this House and the British public what
               he tells other Heads of Government? What are the Prime Minister's guiding principles
               on Europe? What has happened to his defence policy? The Labour party manifesto
               states: <quote>"Our security will continue to be based on Nato"</quote>, and contains
               a commitment to the Western European Union, which is clearly under threat. Following
               the Amsterdam summit, the Prime Minister described proposals along precisely the
               lines now being suggested as, <quote>"an ill-judged Franco-German transplant
                  operation"</quote>. Why has he changed his mind so dramatically? Do not the
               proposals in fact endanger our commitment to NATO? The Prime Minister says that he
               wants to be fully engaged in Europe, but would it not be more accurate to say that,
               whatever the circumstances, he will go with the flow? Earlier this year, the
               Government promised to make EU enlargement a priority. Why is the Prime Minister now
               content for the timetable for the entry of countries such as Poland and Hungary to
               slip further? Will he confirm that they may not be able to join the European Union
               until 2005 or later - 15 years after they threw off communism and first expressed an
               interest in joining? In their original Foreign Office mission statement, the
               Government promised to work for a Europe of independent nation states. How does that
               promise fit with this agreement at Vienna - an agreement that can be summarised in
               the first sentence of the communique: <quote>"European integration has gained new
                  momentum"</quote>? The Prime Minister obviously agrees that that is a true
               statement of the facts, as he signed up to the communique. What has happened to the
               Foreign Secretary's assertion in August that <quote>"Maastricht was the high-water
                  mark of European integration"</quote>? <quote>"European integration has gained new
                  momentum"</quote> is the first phrase of the communique that the Prime Minister
               has signed - and it has done so while he has been Prime Minister, saying one thing in
               one place and something else in another. So let us have some straight answers. Is
               that greater integration something that the Prime Minister welcomes? If it is, why
               does he not say so, instead of running around Europe giving more false impressions
               than Rory Bremner? If that is not something that he welcomes, why does he not do
               something about it? And if he does not know whether it is something that he welcomes,
               he does not deserve to be Prime Minister.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>First, let me deal with some of the issues of fact. The right hon. Gentleman took
               me to task on duty free. Might I remind him that the people that agreed to abolish
               duty free were the previous Conservative Government, in 1991? Of course, the
               difficulty that we have had in the duty free argument is that unanimity is required
               to change the plans precisely because of the agreement that the Conservative
               Government made. As for the right hon. Gentleman's claim that I said one thing to the
               Austrian newspapers and another to the British press, that is apparently based on an
               interview that I gave to an Austrian newspaper, a transcript of which we provided to
               the British press; so I hardly think that that is consistent with saying a different
               thing to them. Finally on the points of detail, the right hon. Gentleman said that we
               had agreed to shove the enlargement timetable back. We agreed no such thing. He said
               that our agreement on defence somehow undermined NATO. I suggest that he reads the
               recent words of Madeleine Albright, who has agreed that it is very sensible that
               Europe, in circumstances where the US does not want to become engaged, is able to do
               more of the cleaning up of problems in its own back yard. Only the Conservative party
               could see that as a negative move. As for the right hon. Gentleman's strictures on
               tax, on unfair tax competition, he asks why I did not come out against the whole
               notion of greater tax co-operation. It could have been for the following reasons.
               First, before the general election, it was agreed by the previous Government that
               they endorsed <quote>"the concern expressed... about the effects of special tax
                  arrangements... and unfair competition"</quote>, and believed <quote>"that
                  consideration is urgently needed of possible remedies to this problem".</quote>
               They then agreed, at the Dublin summit in 1996, to set up the taxation policy group,
               and the first meeting of the group took place under the previous Conservative
               Government. I feel that that would have somewhat inhibited me in saying that it was
               all wrong. Of course, the then Government were quite right in doing that, because
               some of the tax practices across Europe are harmful to this country, so it is
               perfectly sensible to have a discussion about them. I may say that the code of
               conduct on tax says in terms, right at the beginning, that it is a political
               commitment, not a legal one. As for tax harmonisation, yes, we did agree words that
               made it very clear that uniform tax rates were ruled out, and made it very clear that
               no one was opposed to proper and fair tax competition. In the House of Commons on 9
               December, I read the right hon. Gentleman a list of all those other Heads of
               Government who had made the same thing clear on behalf of their Governments - the
               French Prime Minister, the Spanish Prime Minister, the Irish Deputy Prime Minister
               and the Italian Finance Minister. I also read a quote from the Euro CBI, expressing a
               similar view. I can add to that list now. The Austrian Prime Minister said:
                  <quote>"We are not against competition, and I am not against tax
                  competition."</quote> Let us see what the Greek Prime Minister said. <quote>"Any
                  effort to create a common tax policy would be pointless."</quote> I could quote to
               the right hon. Gentleman virtually any newspaper anywhere in Europe, ruling out tax
               harmonisation in the terms that he has described it. There is only one discordant
               note on tax harmonisation - the person who said this: <quote>"We always accepted
                  there was a case for minimal tax harmonisation... It was perfectly well known
                  there was a case for minimal tax harmonisation for the development of the single
                  market."</quote>

               was that? The shadow Chancellor last week. What did the Leader of the Opposition say
               this morning? He described the communique as the greatest threat to British
               independence for decades. More important than the Maastricht treaty, or the Single
               European Act? That statement shows how extreme the Conservative party has become. If
               the Conservative party was in power today, we would not have an ally anywhere. We
               would have no influence, no authority and no ability to get our own way - nothing.
               The Leader of the Opposition says that he wants to build alliances in Europe: for
               heaven's sake, he cannot even build alliances in his own party. I think it was the
               previous Prime Minister who said that the small group of Euro-sceptics was trying to
               give his leadership the run-around. He said that that group needed the men in white
               coats to come to rescue him. Under the present leader of the Conservative party, the
               lunatics have taken over the asylum. That is the position into which the right hon.
               Gentleman has put his party. He is not in charge of it. He is not running his party.
               The policy of the right hon. Gentleman's party is determined by the headbangers with
               whom he has surrounded himself in his shadow Cabinet. That is the truth, and the

               Gentleman's position and that of his party, the country's national interest lies in
               being part of Europe. That is the way to win in Europe and that is what this

               firmly in the way in which the European Union works. In particular, we have agreed
               that the subsidiarity protocol - the Amsterdam treaty - should be applied
               immediately. We intend to examine existing laws when significant new legislation is
               proposed to ascertain whether they should be modified or repealed. That agenda on
               subsidiarity is making progress, but we must not let up on it at all. We must be
               eternally vigilant in pushing this agenda forward. I believe that most people in
               Europe can see that there are certain areas in which Europe should work more closely

               the reasons that we have given, we do not believe that that is satisfied by entry

               the rebate. On any basis of CAP reform now being proposed, the British rebate will
               remain justified. I agree that we need fundamental reform of the CAP, and we are
               certainly prepared to examine mechanisms such as co-financing to try to get that
