               <note>Urgent Question</note>To ask the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on
               the European Council meeting of 19 and 20 December 2013.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#LIDINGTON">
            <seg>I have been asked to reply. The European Council focused on three things: defence;
               economic and monetary union; and EU enlargement and association agreements. On
               defence, the Prime Minister made it clear that NATO would remain the bedrock of our
               national defence. As a result of United Kingdom lobbying, NATOs Secretary-General
               Rasmussen was invited to attend and address the Council as a symbol of the importance
               of the European Unions efforts, which complement rather than duplicate the role of
               NATO in our collective security. It is right for European countries to co-operate on
               defence issues such as tackling piracy, and this country has consistently supported
               other European allies, including the French efforts in Mali. However, it is important
               that defence co-operation is driven by nations themselves, on a voluntary basis,
               according to their own priorities and needs, and not by the Brussels institutions. My
               right hon. Friend the Prime Minister ensured that the conclusions excluded any
               ambiguous language or proposals that could lead to new bureaucracy, new EU
               institutions or increased EU competence on defence and security matters, including
               any ambitions to own dual-use capabilities such as remotely piloted air systems. The
               conclusions of the Council were clear that nations, not the EU institutions, were in
               the driving seat of defence policy and would remain there. On economic and monetary
               union, the United Kingdom is not in the eurozone and will not be joining the euro,
               but we want our trading partners in Europe to have a strong and stable currency and
               we support their efforts to achieve that, provided that Britains interest are
               properly protected. My right hon. Friend ensured that there would be no financial
               liability for this country from banking union or from any future euro area mechanism
               of loans or guarantees for eurozone countries The conclusions also reiterate the
               importance of making the EU more competitive, including cutting red tape for
               business. On enlargement and association agreements, the European Council welcomed
               the initialling of association agreements with Moldova and Georgia, and made it clear
               that the EUs offer to Ukraine remained open. The United Kingdom has long supported
               enlargement because the prospect of EU membership has proved a huge driver for peace,
               prosperity and reform across our continent. My right hon. Friend made it clear that
               he continued to support enlargement and saw it as one of the European Unions greatest
               strengths. At the same time, however, he argued that when new countries join the EU
               in future, we should look again at the transitional arrangements for the free
               movement of workers. He argued, too, that the free movement of workers was different
               from the free movement of people seeking the best benefit deal. Other member states
               share our concerns about this matter, and we look forward to continuing those
               discussions over the coming year.</seg>

         <u who="#STUART">
            <seg>Delightful as it is to see the Europe Minister here today, it is the Prime Minister
               who is meant to make statements following European Council meetings. Why is the Prime
               Minister not here today? If he has a good excuse for not being here today, why could
               he not have made a statement yesterday? Is it now Government policy not to make
               statements following European Council meetings, even though the House has observed
               that practice for many years? It would be particularly regrettable if that were the
               case, given that we no longer have pre-Council debates. Does the Minister think, on
               reflection, when he reads the written ministerial statement, that even if the Prime
               Minister had to make such a statement, the one published inHansardis not brief, but
               tawdry? It really is quite an insult, particularly when compared with the official
               Council conclusions. The written statement makes it clear that there will be no EU
               ownership, no EU headquarters, no reference to Europes armed forces, no European
               pooled acquisition mechanisms, no EU assets and fleets, no EU drones and no EU
               air-to-air refuelling tankers. Of course, that leaves one to wonder what there will
               be, given that this meeting was the first since the Lisbon treaty came into force
               where the Council had a themed debate focusing on defence. How does the Governments
               statement square with the Council conclusions, which say: The European Council
               remains committed to delivering key capabilities and addressing critical shortfalls
               through concrete projects by Member States, supported by the European Defence Agency?
               Given that whole list of noes, including on the institutions, what is the role and
               function of the European Defence Agency? Similarly, given that there are meant to be
               no EU drones, what are we to make of the Council conclusion that we remain committed
               to a 2020 to 2025 time frame for the preparations for a programme of a
               next-generation European Medium Altitude Long Endurance RPAS; the establishment of an
               RPAS user community group and European Commission regulations on that? The Council
               conclusions also state: The European Council welcomes the Commission communication
               Towards a more competitive and efficient defence and security sector. It notes the
               intention of the Commission to develop, in close cooperation with the High
               Representative and the European Defence Agency, a roadmap for implementation of a
               more co-ordinated defence industry. Will the Minister comment on the clear
               contradiction between the written ministerial statement and the conclusions? I have
               two final points to make. First, how does the statement square with the French Prime
               Ministers demand for the setting up of a permanent fund to finance operations such as
               Frances operation in the Central African Republic? Secondly, did the Prime Minister
               have any discussions with the new German Defence Minister, Ursula von der Leyen, who
               until that point had been personally very deeply committed to a united states of
               Europe?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#LIDINGTON">
            <seg>First, I am grateful for the hon. Ladys words of welcome. Let me respond to her
               first question by reminding her that since May 2010 my right hon. Friend the Prime
               Minister has made no fewer than 18 oral statements here following Councils that took
               place while Parliament was sittingthat is double the number of such oral statements
               given by his immediate predecessor. It has been the practice of successive
               Governments not to make an oral statement following Councils taking place during a
               recess, and my right hon. Friend therefore made a full written ministerial statement
               on Monday, which set out in detail the key outcomes from this Council. On the hon.
               Ladys important points about common security and defence policy, the key is to
               understand the distinction between ownership by the EU of defence capabilities, which
               we do not support and have resisted successfully, and co-operation by European
               countries in providing greater defence and security capabilities. What was good about
               the conclusions both of the December European Council and of the previous weeks
               Foreign Affairs Council on CSDP matters was that they made it very clear that the EU
               first had to work with, and not duplicate, the efforts of NATO and work alongside
               other partners in different parts of the world. Secondly, they made it clear that the
               EU would look for ways in which to encourage co-operation on capabilities, for
               example, on drones, which she mentioned. That is not some new EU-directed operation,
               but a facility that individual members of the EU can decide whether or not to take
               part in. There is no secret plan to direct some Euro drone out of the Berlaymont; it
               is very different. It is about co-operation between willing member states. On the
               defence industry point, the conclusions made it clear that the European defence
               sector needed to become more competitive and efficient. The language that we
               successfully negotiated makes it clear that rather than there being any question of
               European national champions, the defence sector must comply with European law, which
               means that there must not be illegal state subsidies, except where subsidies are
               explicitly protected under the treaties. The language also makes it very clear that
               we, or indeed any other country, are not in any way constrained from continuing to
               work with the United States or other international partners on our defence
               industries. When the hon. Lady comes to look in more detail at the conclusions, I
               hope that she will agree that it was a good outcome for the United Kingdom and a
               successful negotiation.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#CASH">
            <seg>This morning, the European Scrutiny Committee cross-examined the Minister for
               Europe on these issues. I have written to the Prime Minister accordingly in relation
               to the fact that he is not here today, as he should be and as our Committee
               recommended in our recent European scrutiny report. The substantive matter is that,
               on the one hand, the Prime Minister did say in his press statement that defence must
               be driven by the nations and not by Brussels diktat, but, on the other, Mr Van Rompuy
               states that we must have credible European scrutiny and a strong, credible, common
               security and defence policy. He also suggests that there is a greater role for
               European defence. Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is impossible to compare
               and to reconcile those different approaches given that there is an ever-increasing
               competence towards European defence irrespective of what the Minister has just
               said?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#LIDINGTON">
            <seg>On my hon. Friends first point, I am aware that he has written to the Prime
               Minister about the matter of oral statements. There is of course that recommendation
               in his Committees report. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will reply to the
               letter. For the record, I repeat the Governments commitment to give their full
               detailed response to the European Scrutiny Committees report in due course, and I
               pledge to do that as soon as we are able. On his point about CSDP matters, I do not
               agree with him. I, too, want to see a European arm of the Atlantic alliance that is
               more credible and effective than it is at the moment. That is certainly a message
               that I hear consistently from the other side of the Atlantic as well. But there is a
               difference between that and the European Union and its institutions owning and
               directing those policies. What we support and advocate is a system in which European
               countries take more seriously their obligations to deliver effective security and
               defence contributions to that trans-Atlantic alliance, and that is where the
               conclusions of the European Council represented a clear victory for our vision. It
               advocated an emphasis on capabilities and political commitment, not on new EU
               institutions and not on the EU ownership. Rather, it insisted on the EU complementing
               NATO and working with the grain of member state responsibility and competence over
               defence policy.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BRYANT">
            <seg>I rather agree with much of what the Minister has said and congratulate him on
               being a rather fine Minister for Europe in that he does not subscribe to some of the
               looney-tunes ideas proposed by some of the people sitting behind him. May I ask him
               about the European Council and whether there was any discussion about who will be the
               new British commissioner? The European Parliament will get to have a view, so should
               not this House get to have a view on who the next British commissioner should
               be?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#LIDINGTON">
            <seg>The straight answer to the hon. Gentlemans question is that there was no discussion
               by this country or any of the other member states of who their nominee might be later
               this year. That is a matter, as always, on which the Government will come to a view
               and we will nominate a man or woman in due course. I must advise the hon. Gentleman
               to be patient for a bit longer.</seg>

         <u who="#HARVEY">

               into joint operations when appropriate, which works very well with the naval
               counter-piracy mission and various land operations in Africa. Given that the US is
               rebalancing its defence efforts to the Pacific and is taking 20% of its defence spend
               out of Europe, is it not more important than ever that the 28 member states of Europe

               reasons, allies of ours in NATO. The very fact that Secretary-General Rasmussen not

               towards a more effective European arm of defence that complemented and supported what

            <seg>for securing the opportunity to discuss this issue in the Chamber today and I share
               her regret that the Prime Minister broke with precedent by not appearing in person to
               answer her question. Let me first touch briefly on the banking union. We welcome the
               progress that has been made, but what discussions were had during the summit to
               ensure that the European Central Banks risk assessments, which are due to be
               conducted later this year, will be sufficiently rigorous? On migration, I welcome the
               Prime Ministers statement that there will be further discussions on the need to find
               a better approach to tackle free movement abuse at an EU level. As we in the
               Opposition have said before, we need to reform the way free movement works so it is
               not seen as a part of a race to the bottom in the world of work. This means looking
               again at the transitional controls, including extending them over longer periods so
               that when new countries move into the European Union we learn the lessons from the
               past. With the recent lifting of transitional controls on Romania and Bulgaria, will
               the Minister set out what steps the Government are taking to address practical
               problems around those who exploit migrant workers to undercut local businesses and
               staff? EU reform will be achieved through building alliances for change among other
               EU member states rather than escalating rhetoric and alienating allies, so can the
               Minister set out who will be leading the negotiations on any proposed EU reform
               agenda on behalf of the Government? The summit should have been a vital opportunity
               to build coalitions to secure the changes that must be made in Europe for Britain
               yet, once again, it seems the Prime Minister viewed it as merely providing the
               opportunity for securing headlines rather than securing change.</seg>

            <seg>The hon. Lady is being unusually churlish. If she looks again at the Councils
               conclusions, she will see that we not only managed to secure important and positive
               British interests that take the development of the common security and defence policy
               in the direction that the UK has long advocated, butand she omitted to mention this
               in her questionwe secured key safeguards on the operation of the banking union to
               ensure that the taxpayers of this country are not liable for the consequences of any
               solvency decision made by our eurozone colleagues. The Opposition might have had the
               grace to pay tribute to what the Prime Minister achieved; otherwise people might come
               to think that the Opposition are somehow dismissive of the interests of British
               taxpayers and of safeguarding them against such liabilities. The hon. Lady asked
               directly about the safeguards that the Government were putting in place for people
               who might be exploited if they came here from other parts of the EU or elsewhere in
               the world. I can reassure her that the Government are doubling the fine for people
               who employ illegal workers and quadrupling the fine for paying people below the
               statutory minimum wage. Under the previous Labour Government, the fine for paying
               somebody below the minimum wage was 5,000 per employer. Under this Government, the
               fine will be 20,000 per employee, not per employer. When it comes to the protection

            <seg>, who has responsibility for defence procurement, took a very hard line and
               successfully won a flat-cash settlement for the EDA this year. We held out and it
               required unanimity for that budget to be agreed. It is simply not the case that we

            <seg>The Commission has a role under the treaties with regard to industrial policy and,
               of course, the operation of the single market. However, the single market as regards
               defence is qualified in the treaties by articles that make it clear that certain
               matters are reserved from normal single market arrangements because they are critical
               to national security. Embodied in the European Council conclusions is a very clear
               direction from all 28 Heads of State and Government that the Commission should stick
               to what is given under the treaties, that there should be no attempt at competence
               creep and that there should be no move towards national European champions or a
               circumvention of the freedom of member states to strike sensible defence partnerships
               with countries outside Europe, and instead that the Commission should work on ways to
               make Europes defence industries more competitive and its defence markets more open in
               a way that, incidentally, would provide great opportunities for the United Kingdoms
               first-class defence suppliers. That move towards greater openness in areas of defence
               procurement is something that United Kingdom companies have been pressing Ministers
               to achieve.</seg>

               people in Syria who have been displaced and are in need and those who have taken

               including that of having a European army. Sadly, there are some new commitments in
               the conclusions, including one in paragraph 9 for an EU Maritime Security Strategy by
               June 2014, on the basis of a joint Communication from the Commission and the High
               Representative, taking into account the opinions of Member States. Is that not
               precisely a case of the Brussels institutions being in the driving seat and an open

               and co-ordinated than they are at present. It does not involve any kind of direction.
               It is trying to establish a framework for effective partnership and working together
               so that we have fewer weak links in securitywhether it be maritime or
               terrestrialanywhere across the continent of Europe. Any weakness in security
               arrangements elsewhere in Europe can end up providing a point of entry for people who
               want to threaten our interests directly, so this sort of effective working together

               numbers of refugees from Syria they are prepared to resettle. Is it not the fact that
               Europe as a whole, with the exception of Germany, has been failing in its
               humanitarian duty to support refugees from Syria? Should not this have been pursued
               more actively by our own Prime Minister at the European Council, and should not it be

               REACH and flexibility in its interpretation, rather than its outright repeal. I can
               point my hon. Friend to the agreement by all Governments to exempt micro-businesses
               from future EU regulations as the default position. I can also point him to the
               Commissions refit package published earlier this year. Among other things, the
               Commission has announced that it will withdraw some proposals to impose extra
               regulations on professions such as hairdressing, and it will also take action about
               the over-prescriptive aspects of the soils directive. A lot more can and should be
               done. That is why we have pressed very hard for the recommendations of the Prime
               Ministers business taskforce to be taken forward, and why we strongly welcome the
               fact that the taskforce report has had strong support from Government leaders

               representations to Spain at the highest level about the fact that this sort of

            <seg>A common defence policy for Europe would clearly undermine the crucial link between
               Europe and America that forms the basis of NATO. What assessment have our Government
               made of the number of our fellow EU member states that favour a common defence

         <u who="#LIDINGTON">
            <seg>It all depends on what is meant by a common defence policy. There is widespread
               support, including in the United States and from the NATO Secretary-General, for
               European members of the transatlantic alliance to be more effective and cohesive in
               their contributions to our joint security arrangements. My hon. Friend is right that
               some people in Europe want to go a great deal further, particularly in some of the
               European institutions, such as the Parliament and the Commission. For rather obvious
               reasons of parliamentary accountability and a consciousness of the importance of
               national sovereignty over defence and foreign policy, there is greater reluctance
               among national Governments. As a rule of thumb, smaller member states often see
               security advantages in closer European integration at defence level, and the
               significant defence players are generally the most conscious of the need to preserve
               national autonomy and to defend what the treaties lay down, which is that defence and
               security remain national competences and rights.</seg>

            <seg>It is important that we do not just make statements at European Councils or the

               embassy in Kiev has been leading on that and encouraging embassies from other
               European countries to do so as well, particularly to get the message through to those
               in the Russian-speaking areas in the east and south of Ukraine that greater
               integration with the worlds biggest single trading market will, in the medium and
               long term, hugely benefit the prosperity of people of every ethnic background within

         <u who="#LIDINGTON">
            <seg>On the hon. Gentlemans last point, there is no question of sleepwalking. There is a

               every EU member unanimously agrees that the relevant standards have been reached by
               the candidate country. Even on the most generous estimate, it will be a fair number
               of years before any of the current candidate countries are in a position to be ready

               of accession, which was negotiated by the last Government and agreed by the House in
               the last Parliament, laid down that the transitional controls on migration from
               Romania and Bulgaria should continue for a maximum of seven years. We were right to
               put transitional controls in place for the full seven-year period. Unlike in the case
               of the 2004 accession states, we are lifting the transitional controls at the same
               time as every other country in the EU that has maintained such controls. The
               situation is therefore somewhat different. The measures that we have announced and

               summit. I was pleased to be supported strongly by my Dutch colleague and a number of
               other Ministers who were present.</seg>

            <seg>Does my right hon. Friend agree that we should be stressing the fact that this
               coalition Government have given unprecedented aid support to the Syrian refugees and
               to individual aid agencies such as UNICEF and the neighbouring countries that are
               doing what they can to address this local humanitarian crisis?</seg>

            <seg>I agree completely with my hon. Friend.</seg>

            <seg>I very much welcome the statement that has been made by the Minister. On the issue
               of security, was there any discussion at the Council of Irans nuclear programme and
               the deal that has been reached, because there is concern among neighbouring Arab
               states, such as Saudi Arabia and other members of the Gulf Co-operation Council, not
               only about the deal but about the fact that it was reached without any
               representations from Arab countries at the table where the discussions took place?
               Does the Minister agree that a country from the GCC should be at the table when there
               are further discussions about Irans nuclear deal?</seg>

         <u who="#LIDINGTON">
            <seg>Iran was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council. Of course, my right hon. Friend
               the Foreign Secretary talks regularly to his counterparts in Germany and to the other
               permanent members of the Security Council about this matter. We also talk to our
               friends in the Gulf Co-operation Council about our relationship with Iran and the
               progress towards an acceptable solution to the Iranian nuclear issue. It is in the
               interests of countries in the region, as well as countries in Europe and north
               America, that such a solution is found as quickly as possible.</seg>

         <u who="#MCCARTNEY">
            <seg>I joined fellow members of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly for a very informative
               briefing at NATO maritime command in Northwood about Operation Ocean Shield, which is
               the NATO operation against piracy off the horn of Africa. After an hour, we were
               asked to sit through pretty much the same briefing, but delivered by an EU admiral,
               about Operation Atalanta, which is the EU operation against Somali piracy. Is not
               that the kind of duplication and confusion in command and control that we must
               reject, and should we not instead commit ourselves fully to NATO?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#LIDINGTON">
            <seg>The two operations off Somalia involve two sets of countries, the membership of
               which is not identical. Having EU and NATO elements means that we are able to involve
               more nations than would otherwise be the case. In practice, the two operations work
               pretty seamlessly together. As I understand it, they apply common rules of
               engagement. The importance of the EU common defence and security policy complementing
               and not duplicating or being a substitute for NATO was reinforced by the presence of
               Secretary-General Rasmussen at the European summit in December. The fact that the
               Secretary-General, on behalf of NATO, felt able to welcome warmly the conclusions
               that had been reached ought to reassure all of us in the House who are champions of
               NATO that there is no threat to NATOs role or primacy here.</seg>
