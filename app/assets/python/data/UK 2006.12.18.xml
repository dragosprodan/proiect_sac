      <body>

         <u who="#BECKETT">
            <seg>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the European
               Council held in Brussels last Thursday and Friday. As the House knows, it is
               customary for my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to make the statement, but I
               have been asked to convey his apologies as he is currently on an official visit to
               the middle east.</seg>
            <seg>There were two main outcomes to the Council. The first, as expected, related to
               enlargement. The Council endorsed the agreement reached earlier in the week by
               Foreign Ministers on what action the European Union should take in response to
               Turkeys failure to implement the Ankara agreement protocol. There was also a wider
               discussion on enlargement strategy.</seg>
            <seg>There had been widespread predictions that the discussion on Turkey at the General
               Affairs Council would be extremely divisive, would spill over into the European
               Council and might risk derailing the process of Turkish accessionthe so-called train
               wreck scenario. But that was avoided. The UK, along with others, made a strong
               strategic case for Turkish membershipa case that I know is shared across the Houseand
               the train remains very much on the track. Negotiations can move forward on 27 of the
               35 chapters of the acquis and, for the first time in an EU of 25, there is positive
               language, which will be adopted by the Council in January, on resuming work without
               delay on a direct trade regulation to end the economic isolation of the Turkish
               Cypriots. No one is in any doubt that Turkey must meet all the requirements and
               obligations of membership before joining the European Union. But as the House has
               consistently agreed, a European Union with Turkey as a member will be stronger,
               richer and more secure.</seg>
            <seg>The conclusions of the European Council further stressed the strategic importance
               of enlargement more generallyin inspiring reform, driving prosperity and
               competitiveness, and strengthening the EUs weight in the world. Those conclusions
               reaffirmed that the EU should keep its commitments towards all the countries that are
               in the enlargement process, moving forward on the basis of strict conditionality at
               all stages of the negotiations and judging each country on its own merits.</seg>
            <seg>The second focus of the Council was to make progress on the very practical issues
               that resonate with, and matter to, the people of Europe and where, through joint
               action, the European Union can make a positive difference on the ground. On climate
               change and energy, the Council built on progress made at the informal summit in
               Lahti. We agreed that the spring Council will discuss options for a global post-2012
               agreement on climate change, consistent with the EUs objective of a maximum global
               temperature increase of 2 C above pre-industrial levels. We reiterated the need for a
               global carbon market and reaffirmed the crucial role and the long-term ambition of
               the EU emissions trading scheme.</seg>
            <seg>The Council called for the priority measures in the Commissions action plan on
               energy efficiency to be implemented rapidly and endorsed the setting up of a network
               of energy security correspondents early next year. The spring 2007 European Council
               is due to adopt a prioritised action plan as part of an integrated approach for a
               secure, environmentally friendly and competitive energy policy for Europe. We also
               agreed that European energy and climate change policy will be discussed by the
               European Council on a regular basis in the future, beginning with an integrated
               debate on those issues at the spring 2007 meeting.</seg>
            <seg>On Africa, we welcomed the progress report on the implementation of the EU strategy
               The EU and Africa: Towards a Strategic Partnership and called for the implementation
               of the priority actions for next year that are identified in that report. We also
               reaffirmed our commitment to working towards a joint EU-Africa strategy, which is to
               be adopted at the second EU-Africa summit in the latter half of 2007.</seg>
            <seg>On the globalisation agenda, we asked the Commission to take a number of concrete
               steps to promote further innovation in Europe. They included presenting a
               comprehensive intellectual property rights strategy in the course of 2007, working up
               proposals for industry-led joint technology initiatives with a view to launching the
               most advanced ones next year, and, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, coming
               up with ways in which to improve the working methods and overall resources of the
               European standardisation bodies. We also agreed to do further work on the idea of a
               European institute of technology.</seg>
            <seg>On justice and home affairs, the Council agreed to consider options for
               strengthening the framework for decision making in order to respond effectively to
               the current challenges in the areas of freedom, security and justice.</seg>
            <seg>On migration, we agreed that we needed to strengthen our efforts on the global
               approach and to make sure that we addressed migration in a comprehensive manner. The
               Council agreed on the next steps that the EU should take in 2007, including detailed
               action in three areas with regard to illegal migration: first, strengthening and
               deepening international co-operation with third countries of origin and transit, for
               example by doing more to integrate migration issues into aid policies and working
               more effectively with third countries to combat human trafficking; secondly,
               strengthening co-operation among members states, for example by intensifying measures
               against illegal employment and developing identification technology at borders; and,
               thirdly, improving the management of the EUs external border, for example by finding
               sustainable and effective ways to enhance the capacity of Frontex. The Council also
               agreed to have a common European asylum system in place by the end of 2010, starting
               with a preliminary evaluation of its first phase next year.</seg>
            <seg>The Council issued separate declarations on Lebanon, Afghanistan, Iran and Africa
               issues. On the middle east peace process, the European Council set out how it would
               engage with a legitimate Palestinian Government who adopted a platform reflecting the
               Quartet principles.</seg>
            <seg>The European Council quite rightly concentrated on areasnot least enlargementin
               which the European Union can make a real difference to the lives of the people of
               Europe. The progress that we made at the Council, and, perhaps just as importantly,
               the dangers that we avoided, demonstrate again the benefit of having a UK Government
               with not just a clear strategy on Europe, but the strong influence, based on
               consistent and close engagement, to see that strategy through. I commend the outcome
               to the House.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#HAGUE">
            <seg>The focus of the summit, as the Foreign Secretary said, was enlargement, which has
               been the European Unions greatest achievement. We join in welcoming Romania and
               Bulgaria to the European Union. As she said, we have long supported Turkeys
               membership of the EU, so we have much agreement with her on that. However, does she
               still agree with us that, as she put it before the summit, the measures proposed, and
               indeed agreed, were too harsh on, and possibly counter-productive towards, Turkey?
               She obviously agrees that Turkey must work to resolve the dispute over access to its
               ports, but that is a challenge to overcome, not an opportunity to deny Turkey
               membership in the future. To resolve these matters, what will the Government and our
               European partners do not only to end the economic isolation of Turkish Cypriots, but
               to ensure that there is movement over time towards Turkeys eventual recognition of
               the Republic of Cyprus and on other measures necessary to bring about Turkish
               membership?</seg>
            <seg>A larger Europe should mean a more flexible Europe, not a less flexible one. It is
               thus right that proposals to abolish vetoes over criminal justice and to move that
               area from an intergovernmental pillar to full Community jurisdiction were not
               adopted. Will the Foreign Secretary make it clear that any such proposal in the
               future will be rejected by Britain? A Government spokesman apparently said at the
               summit: <quote>We are prepared to give up the veto on some security issues</quote>.
               Will she say what those issues are?</seg>
            <seg>Does the Foreign Secretary not agree with the European Scrutiny Committee that the
               use of the so-called gangplank clause would be of constitutional importance and, as
               the Committee said, <quote>it is vital that there should be no doubt or equivocation
                  about the Governments position?</quote>
            </seg>
            <incident>
               <desc>Interruption</desc>
            </incident>
            <seg>I use the Committees form of words. Are the Government in fact willing to give up
               the veto on some of these issues? Does the right hon. Lady accept our view that that
               would be a serious mistake that would limit British sovereignty in a sensitive
               area?</seg>
            <seg>Will the Foreign Secretary tell the House why the employment chapter is being used
               to introduce EU legislation on migration? Should that not be done through immigration
               provisions or not at all? Why is the EU now extending its powers into Community
               integration, in paragraph 24 of the Council conclusions? Does not a common asylum
               policy run the risk of losing national control in that area?</seg>
            <seg>Our view is that the EU should concentrate on where it can add value to its peoples
               priorities, so we welcome what the Council agreed on climate change. Does the right
               hon. Lady agree that the EU does not need new powers here but must make better use of
               existing ones? Europe is not on track to meet its Kyoto target, so will the
               Government ensure that the revision of the EU trading scheme receives urgent
               attention?</seg>
            <seg>On global poverty, the Council discussed the Africa strategy; it is right to make
               that a priority. But does the Foreign Secretary agree that many of the EUs
               policiesthe common agricultural policy, trade barriers and so oncontinue to make
               poverty in developing countries worse? Nevertheless, climate change and global
               poverty are real, tangible issues on which the European Union should be
               concentrating.</seg>
            <seg>The Foreign Secretary, however, failed to mention one thingthe European
               constitution. It was on the agenda and a summit has been called of the 18 nations
               that have ratified it. Her predecessor, who is sitting next to her, the right hon.
               Member for Blackburn <note>Mr. Straw</note>, said that <quote>"it was hard to argue
                  that the Constitution is not dead".</quote>
               <note>The Leader of the House of Commons (Mr. Jack Straw) indicated assent.</note>
            </seg>
            <seg>The right hon. Gentleman nods. The Dutch Government have said that the constitution
               is dead. But some people are now arguing for its resuscitation, so will the Foreign
               Secretary make it clear that the Government have no plans to ratify the constitution
               and will not revive such plans? Her predecessor stated that the Government would not
               bring in any part of the constitution through the back door, so will the right hon.
               Lady guarantee that any new treaty that contains any significant part of the
               constitution or increases the EUs powers in any way would merit the promised
               referendum?</seg>
            <seg>The European Union has the potential to be a great force for good in the world, but
               if it returns to the old ways of deeper integration, the constitutions failure will
               be repeated again and again. So is it not the Governments urgent task to lead that
               debate and convince our partners of the need for an open, flexible, modern European
               Union which all its nations need?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BECKETT">
            <seg>First, to pick up on what the right hon. Gentleman said about Turkey, I recognise
               and much appreciate the common ground in the House on that issue. On the
               relationships between Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus, he may be aware that one of
               the declarationsthe presidential statement that accompanied the Council
               conclusionshas encouraged a return to the United Nations process to begin to resolve
               some of the issues. I sincerely hope that that will indeed be successful.</seg>
            <seg>The right hon. Gentleman spoke about the need for greater flexibility as the
               European Union becomes larger, and I agree with that, but he also spoke about what he
               was reluctant to call the passerelle on justice and home affairs issues. I am not
               aware of the statement that he quoted from a Government spokesman. I simply repeat
               what we have said to him before: there is flexibility on this issue in existing
               treaties and we do not rule out, as a matter of principle, ever exercising such
               flexibility. Certainly there are no proposals at present to which we are particularly
               attracted, but given that that flexibility is in existing treaties, it would be a
               mistake automatically to rule out its use. We would discuss and consider issues on
               their merits and make a decision on that basis. I feel confident that this will be an
                  ongoing<seg> exchange, but I remind the right hon. Gentleman yet again that no
                  Labour Government have given up the principle of the vetothat was done under Lady
                  Thatcher.</seg> On asylum, we understand the right hon. Gentlemans concern. We are
               anxious to preserve the right kind of flexibility on the issue, certainly in the
               United Kingdom, where we believe that that can be achieved. I share his view that the
               European Union should increasingly concentrate on areas where it adds value. He
               touched on the emissions trading scheme, and I hope that the House is aware that the
               United Kingdom is the only member state to have its proposals for the next round of
               the emissions trading scheme accepted. Everyone else was told that their proposals
               were not sufficiently stringent, so we are making progress and are heading in the
               right direction. I share his view that we must look at our wider policies, including
               the common agricultural policy, if we are to deal with global poverty, not least
               through trade.</seg>
            <seg>Finally, the right hon. Gentleman says that the constitutional treaty is dead, but
               in my first debate on the subject as Foreign Secretary, we had an interesting
               theological discussion in which my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda <note>(Chris
                  Bryant)</note>, who happily is present this afternoon, defined the treaty,
               theologically and very accurately, as being in limbo, on the grounds that that was
               the place for the unborn. That is certainly incontestable. As to bringing things
               back, whether through the front or back door, there is no suggestion that we would do
               any such thing, but we will see what proposals are put forward.</seg>

               still our firm intention to keep open the door for future enlargement, not least
               because we believe that that will be a strong driver towards reform. Again, I think

               the intention to focus early attention on climate change, and to consider ways of
               achieving greater co-operation and co-ordination on migration. There is also support
               on both sides of the House for the reaffirmation of the enlargement process as
               regards Turkey. It was right for the summit to emphasise that all applicants must
               meet the tough entry requirements in full, but is the Foreign Secretary confident
               that the new impact assessments will not simply provide the opponents of enlargement

               extension? On the wider peace process, how will the Prime Ministers latest efforts in
               the region be linked to the new European initiative agreed at the summit, and what

               must always view such matters with caution, but I am reasonably confident that having
               rigorous requirements that are properly monitored will not necessarily prove to be
               just a stumbling block and an obstacle to any future enlargement, whether in respect
               of Turkey or any other applicant state. There was a discussion on precisely that
               issue. The overwhelming majority of the member states have ruled outat least three
               times so far, in my experiencethe idea that we should introduce some kind of new
               conditionality. There is a clear recognition among member states, just as there is
               across the House, of the value of applications in driving reform. On the extension of
               the temporary international mechanism, I am not carrying in my head the latest
               figures, but I can tell the hon. Gentleman both that the European Union as a whole
               has put more money than last year into helping the Palestinian people through the
               present crisis, and that the UK is the largest donor to that overall EU funding. If
               we obtain information in the near future about what the extension will mean, I will
