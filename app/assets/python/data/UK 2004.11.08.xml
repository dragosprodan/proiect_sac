         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall make a statement on the European Council that
               took place in Brussels on 4 and 5 November. I should like to thank Prime Minister
               Balkenende and the Dutch Government for their arrangements for the summit, and for
               the way in which they have conducted their presidency to date. The Council was
               inevitably dominated by Iraq, given the presence of Dr. Allawi, the Iraqi Prime
               Minister.</seg>
            <seg>First, let me express what I know will be the sentiments of the entire House in
               sending our profound condolences to the families of the Black Watch soldiers killed
               by a terrorist bomb in Iraq last week and our sympathy to those soldiers injured
               yesterday in another terrorist attack. We salute their dedication, professionalism
               and, above all, sheer and undaunted courage. They are an example to us all and we can
               and should be very proud of them.</seg>
            <seg>Let us also be very clear about the fundamental importance to Britain's security of
               what the Black Watch and, indeed, the British armed forces in the south of Iraq are
               doing. Defeat of terrorism in Iraq is defeat for this new and virulent form of global
               terrorism everywhere. A democratic Iraq is the last thing the terrorists want to see.
               It is precisely for that reason—because victory for the terrorists would damage
               security around the world, including here in Britain—that we have to hold firm, be
               resolute and see this through, including in Falluja.</seg>
            <seg>The action by allied and Iraqi forces under way in Falluja would cease now,
               immediately, if the terrorists and insurgents who are using Falluja as a base for
               terrorism laid down their weapons and agreed to participate in the elections. Over
               the past few months, as he explained today, Prime Minister Allawi has tried to
               persuade them to do so. They have refused, not because they are fighting a foreign
               occupation—if the terrorism stopped, American, British and other troops would leave
               Iraq—but because they are fighting democracy. They are fighting to stop democratic
               elections, supervised by the UN and due to take place in January. They know that
               while Falluja remains outside the control of the UN-endorsed Government, they can use
               it to wreck elections. Why do the terrorists fear elections? Because they know that
               given the chance to vote for their own Government, Iraqis would reject the extremism
               and fanaticism these terrorists represent.</seg>
            <seg>The powerful speech made by Dr. Allawi to the European Council made precisely those
               points. He appealed for Europe's help. Some promised support of a military nature;
               others promised only financial support. But all of the Council agreed that it was in
               the interests of global security for Iraqi elections to take place. The Council also
               agreed a comprehensive package of EU assistance for Iraq, including a further
               programme of financial and logistical support for the elections, and financing for
               the UN protection force. This is on top of €300 million of humanitarian and
               reconstruction support from the EU over the past two years.</seg>
            <seg>Following the re-election of President Bush, the Council also agreed that a close
               transatlantic partnership was fundamental to building international peace, security
               and prosperity, and that we now need to strengthen that alliance so that we can
               intensify our work together in addressing the main international threats and
               challenges of the moment, including regional conflicts, terrorism and the
               proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Council also heard a presentation
               from the former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Wim Kok, on his mid-term review of
               the Lisbon strategy on European economic competitiveness. He rightly concluded that
               Europe has to do far more to improve its underlying economic performance if it is to
               respond to the challenges of Asia and the United States, and he sensibly highlighted
               the importance of completing the single market, developing flexible labour markets,
               and promoting sustainable growth. The Council adopted a new five-year work programme
               of measures in the area of justice and home affairs. There are great benefits for the
               UK in co-operation with our European partners on these issues. Illegal immigration
               affects all member states. However, the opt-in protocol for Britain</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#SPEAKER">
            <seg>Order. Mr. Bellingham, you had better be quiet, otherwise I will put you out of the
               Chamber.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>The opt-in protocol for Britain, negotiated in Amsterdam in 1997, remains. It is
               also enshrined in the new constitutional treaty. We have used it successfully over
               the past five years to opt in to new measures on asylum and combating illegal
               immigration, and to opt out of measures on legal migration, frontiers and visas. The
               protocol gives us the right to decide whether to participate in each item of the EU
               work programme and makes nonsense of claims that Britain has given up the right to
               control its own borders. If, of course, we opt in because we want a particular
               measure, it is in our interests that in a Europe of 25 and soon 27 or 28 countries
               the use of a veto by another country cannot block the measure.</seg>
            <seg>Finally, the President-designate of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso, briefed us
               on his proposals for restructuring the new Commission. He has reacted decisively to
               resolve the dispute with the European Parliament, and I am confident that as a result
               the new Commission will be able to take office soon. In summary, the meeting once
               again underlined the importance to Britain of maintaining both a strong relationship
               with the United States of America and a strong place in the Councils of the European
               Union. Both partnerships are vital to the British national interest and it will
               remain the policy of this Government at least to nurture both.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#HOWARD">
            <seg>I join the Prime Minister in expressing our deepest sympathy to the families of the
               soldiers of the Black Watch who have lost their lives and our good wishes for a
               speedy recovery to those who have been injured. I join, too, in the tribute that the
               Prime Minister paid to the outstanding dedication, professionalism and courage of the
               Black Watch.</seg>
            <seg>I welcome both the European Council's discussions with Prime Minister Allawi and
               the financial contribution towards elections in Iraq. I support everything that the
               Prime Minister said about the importance of defeating terrorism in Iraq and
               elsewhere. Events in Samarra have shown that bringing an area under ostensible
               control does not, sadly, always mean an end to insurgency. Can the Prime Minister
               tell the House as much as he can about the coalition's plans to deal with the
               situation that is likely to arise in Iraq after the battle for Falluja?</seg>
            <seg>I welcome the Council's agreement on the importance of a close transatlantic
               partnership and on the need to strengthen the alliance. What specific proposals does
               the   Prime Minister have to bring that about? The communiqué emphasises the middle
               east peace process, although his statement was silent on the subject. Is it not time
               to turn again to the road map? Should we not now seize the moment to make real
               progress on the ground towards a secure Israel within internationally recognised
               borders and a viable Palestinian state?</seg>
            <seg>The European Council also discussed Iran's nuclear programme. Has preliminary
               agreement been reached on that issue with Iran? In the past, Iran has not complied
               with the undertakings that it has given, so what measures are proposed to make sure
               that it does so this time? The communiqué also expresses grave concern about Darfur.
               Has not the time come for immediate United Nations action, including automatic
               sanctions, to ensure that the Sudanese Government reign in the militias? Should not
               the African Union forces be given the mission to keep the peace, rather than just
               monitor the situation, to put an end to the dreadful attacks on civilians that still
               continue in that area?</seg>
            <seg>The Prime Minister has boasted endlessly about progress on economic reform in
               Europe. In 1998, he said <quote>"We have to reform Europe and we are winning that
                  battle"</quote>. In 2000, he said that there had been <quote>"a sea change in
                  European economic thinking... away from heavy-handed intervention and
                  regulation, towards a new approach based on enterprise, innovation and
                  competition."</quote>
               <bibl type="source">Official Report, 27 March 2000; Vol. 347, c. 21.</bibl>
            </seg>
            <seg>But is not that all talk? Has not Romano Prodi admitted that economic reform in
               Europe has been a <quote>"big failure"</quote>? Has not the director general of the
               CBI said that Europe has got to change? Has not Wim Kok said that <quote>"too many
                  targets will be seriously missed"</quote>? The aim of the Lisbon agenda was to
               make Europe the most dynamic economy in the world by 2010. Is not that just a pipe
               dream? Will not we all pay the price in terms of lower productivity, lower living
               standards and fewer jobs? Promises on economic reform are not the only areas where
               the Prime Minister has been all talk. Four years ago, he said that he did not want a
                  <quote>"single, legally binding document called a Constitution"</quote> yet that
               is exactly what he signed a week ago. The director general of the CBI has said that
               the constitution will not help business. The Prime Minister's own former chief
               economic adviser has said that it will <quote>"entrench Europe's economic failings
                  and drag Britain down too"</quote>.</seg>
            <incident>
               <desc>Interruption</desc>
            </incident>
            <seg>Well, this was someone to whom the Prime Minister listened for six and a half
               years, so I think that his views might be entitled to a modicum of respect. Is not it
               the case that the constitution will make Europe's economy even less flexible, even
               less competitive and even more sluggish than it is today? Earlier this year, the
               Prime Minister promised that <quote>"we will retain completely our control over our
                  asylum policy"</quote>. But was not that promise all talk? At the summit, a
                  <quote>"common European asylum system"</quote> was agreed. The communiqué that the
               Prime Minister signed says: <quote>"the Constitutional Treaty greatly increases the
                  powers of the European Court of Justice in that area"</quote>. Does not that mean
               in plain English that more and more decisions on asylum and immigration will no
               longer be taken in this elected Parliament, but will in future be taken by the
               unelected judges of the European Court?</seg>
            <seg>It is no good the Prime Minister's talking about opt-outs when he has chosen to opt
               into all the major measures on asylum. Is not all this a huge lost opportunity? Are
               not there practical policies that would turn some of the Prime Minister's rhetoric
               into action? If the Prime Minister means what he says about listening to people on
               Europe, why will not he match our pledge to set a date next year for the referendum
               on the constitution so that the people can have their say? If he means what he says
               about a modern Europe, why does not he put the case for greater flexibility,
               including the return of powers from Brussels to Britain so that we are no longer
               forced to accept so many new regulations that we do not support?</seg>
            <seg>In 1997, the Prime Minister promised to <quote>"lead a campaign for reform in
                  Europe"</quote>. Seven and a half years later, in a diverse Union of 25, and in a
               fiercely competitive world, is not the need for a modern, flexible, reformed European
               Union more urgent than ever and under this Prime Minister, despite all his talk, are
               not we further away from it than we have ever been before?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>First, let me deal with the questions on Iraq. In respect of Samarra, Najaf, Tal
               Afar and other places that have been taken back into the control of the Iraqi
               Government and Iraqi forces, it is of course true that terrorists will carry on
               actions in those places, as they did in Samarra just a few days ago.</seg>
            <seg>There are a couple of interesting points, however. When those terrorists have been
               cleared out of these cities, it has become very obvious, contrary to what we were
               told beforehand, that they did not enjoy the support of local people; on the
               contrary, local people were all too glad to get rid of them so that they could get
               back to the lives that they wanted to lead.</seg>
            <seg>Let us be clear that the purpose of the action in Falluja is to stop it being used
               as a base for terrorists and insurgents who are killing innocent people in Iraq and
               anybody who tries to make the country better. If and when we take back control of
               Falluja so that it is in the control of the Iraqi Government, a process of
               reconstruction will follow, as happened in Samarra and Najaf, where literally
               hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent on reconstruction projects. The
               people can then participate fully in the elections. I do not minimise the
               difficulties but it is essential for the holding of democratic, free and fair
               elections that the power and grip of the terrorists and insurgents in some parts of
               Iraq be broken. That is why Prime Minister Allawi has authorised the
               operations.</seg>
            <seg> </seg>
            <seg>It is extremely important that we make progress on the middle east now. Progress
               must be towards a two-state solution; an Israel confident about its security and a
               viable, independent Palestinian state. It is essential to take measures to make
               progress on that. I hope that we shall do that as soon as possible. As I said when I
               congratulated President Bush on his re-election, it is the single most pressing
               political challenge of the moment.</seg>
            <seg>We are still at the point of negotiation on Iran. A series of issues has been
               agreed at political director level, but not yet at intergovernmental level between
               the European three—France, Germany and the United Kingdom—and the Iranian Government
               but we are hopeful that we will be able to make some progress in the next few
               days.</seg>
            <seg>On Sudan, it is important to make it clear that not only the Sudanese Government
               should exercise restraint; some of the Sudanese rebel groups must do so. A series of
               measures has been laid down for the Sudanese Government and they must follow them. If
               they do not, there has to be reference to the Security Council and necessary measures
               must be taken.</seg>
            <seg>I agree with the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe <note>(Mr.
                  Howard)</note> that the African Union should not only increase the number of
               troops available there but make it clear that, if possible, it can keep the peace as
               well as monitor what is happening there. However, it is a difficult and delicate
               situation for the troops that are going into it. We are watching the situation
               carefully. My right hon. Friends the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for
               International Development are in constant touch with their opposite numbers in other
               capitals and with the Sudanese Government. However, the situation remains serious. If
               anything, it has got worse rather than better in the past few weeks. If we do not get
               obedience and compliance with the measures that the international community laid
               down, we will have to revert to the matter at Security Council level and take
               action.</seg>
            <seg>It is worth pointing out that, since 1999, some 6 million jobs have been created in
               Europe and liberalisation has taken place in many sectors under the Lisbon strategy
               process. I agree that it is important that we do more but the right hon. and learned
               Gentleman's policy of being a semi-marginalised player in Europe will not help to get
               economic reform. As for the woeful things that he claims will happen if the EU
               constitution is passed, I merely point out that he used to make the same predictions
               when he was Secretary of State for Employment in the previous Government about the
               social chapter. I think I remember his saying that 500,000 jobs would desert Britain
               if we signed the social chapter. We signed it and 2 million extra jobs have been
               created since. His powers of prediction are not good.</seg>
            <seg>I am surprised that the right hon. and learned Gentleman opposes our opt-in on
               asylum. A few months ago, he made a speech in which he said that a process whereby
               countries decided whether to opt in to specific measures was precisely the direction
               in which Europe wanted to go. We have delivered that, but the moment that we do so,
               he switches around 180°, in his usual opportunistic fashion, and says that it is a
               disaster for the country.</seg>
            <seg>The right hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned the charter of rights. Let me read
               part of our protocol to him. It states: <quote>"No decision of the Court of Justice
                  interpreting any such provision"— to do with asylum and immigration— "shall be
                  binding upon or applicable in the United Kingdom."</quote> That destroys the
               effect of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's point. As for his view that we
               should have a bold strategy of renegotiating the existing membership of the European
               Union, it is, as some his hon. Friends have pointed out, simply not on the table. He
               would have to get the agreement of every one of the other members to renegotiate
               that. How many members have agreed?</seg>
            <incident>
               <desc>Hon. Members: "Norway."</desc>
            </incident>
            <seg>I think we are back to the Norway issue. Following the right hon. and learned
               Gentleman's comments at the weekend, it is extraordinary that, in his first year as
               Conservative leader, he has managed to achieve a foreign policy position that would
               make us a marginalised member of the European Union and not welcome in the White
               House either. Only his leadership could have brought the Conservative conception of
               foreign policy to such a pass.</seg>

         <u who="#KENNEDY">
            <seg>I thank the Prime Minister for his statement. May I join him, on behalf of my right
               hon. and hon. Friends, in extending our condolences to the families of the Black
               Watch personnel who have been killed or injured, as well as to those of the very
               brave civilians who are giving their support and assistance to the Black Watch in
               their extremely dangerous job? The families not only of serving Black Watch personnel
               but of the Scots Guards, who have reportedly been placed on replacement standby,
               would welcome some clarification of the Government's position on possible replacement
               forces, given that they are clearly adhering to their view that the Black Watch will
               be home by Christmas. The House and the families concerned would welcome any
               clarification that the Prime Minister can give them on that issue, not least because
               there were contradictory reports in the media this weekend on whether replacement
               forces would be deployed at the end of this period.</seg>
            <seg>Whatever the original principled disagreements over the basis for the war, and,
               indeed, the more recent divergences of view over what many of us regarded as a
               strategic political and military shift over the Black Watch deployment, there is
               obviously consensus on wanting to see the democratic timetable and an independent
               Iraq achieved, and on our having no truck with terrorism. I am sure that the Prime
               Minister will acknowledge, however, that the real concerns over this American-led
               assault on Falluja—not least in terms of the civilian casualties involved—give rise
               to fair and legitimate questions. These questions have been raised on the
               international stage by Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and
               they are also arising within the Iraqi interim Government, not least in the different
               viewpoints now being expressed by the Prime Minister and the President there.</seg>
            <seg>Does the Prime Minister agree that, whatever the events of the next few days and
               weeks in Falluja, it is essential that the Americans' conduct does not squander any
               moral capital or undermine the legitimacy of the democratic process, especially if
               that were to result in a Sunni boycott of any elections taking place in January? On a
               practical as well as moral level, will the Prime Minister address the question of
               what contingency plans have been put in place to deal with those insurgents who have
               already fled Falluja, or who will in due course be flushed out of the city and move
               to other parts of the country, perhaps to carry on their notorious activities there?
               Formal hostilities in Falluja are commencing as we speak, so I am sure that the Prime
               Minister will acknowledge that these are responsible questions to which the House
               will genuinely want to return in due course.</seg>
            <seg>On the allied issue of Iran, the Prime Minister has already responded to some of
               the discussions that have taken place. He has an important summit meeting coming up
               later this week with President Bush, which is surely welcome, given the agenda that
               will be in front of them. If, as he suggested a moment ago, further discussions among
               the three European powers—the United Kingdom, France and Germany—will be taking place
               over the next few days, is he hopeful that he will be in a position to ask the
               President to endorse the strategy of these three countries in regard to Iran later
               this week in Washington? On completion of that summit meeting, does he intend to
               return to the House with a further statement of this kind, perhaps this time next
               week, to enable further discussions to take place?</seg>
            <seg>On the issue of the eventual composition of the European Commission, does the Prime
               Minister agree that the way in which the European Parliament, as the directly elected
               representative body of all the member states, was able to have an impact on the
               President of the Commission should encourage one and all of a Eurosceptic disposition
               or otherwise that it is the proper forum in which proper European parliamentary
               pressure can be exerted to achieve a healthier, more desirable outcome? Does he also
               agree that this recent crisis, so-called, in fact redoubles the argument for a
               smaller Commission—ultimately—of precisely the type that the constitution puts
               forward?</seg>
            <seg>Finally, on the issue of the constitution and the referendum pertaining to it, the
               Prime Minister has said that it is the Government's position that there should be a
               referendum in due course. Will he confirm that the Government, irrespective of what
               might happen in referendums that may precede one here, will proceed with a
               referendum, come what may, in this country? If the type of economic liberalism and
               greater economic flexibility, to which he alluded in his statement and which were
               discussed at the summit, are achieved, will he perhaps, on a future occasion, see
               scope for doubling up a referendum on the constitution with one on the single
               currency?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>First, in respect of Iraq, let me say that although we had a disagreement about the
               war, I accept entirely that the questions the right hon. Gentleman is asking are
               perfectly legitimate ones to ask in this connection. I have made it clear that the
               Black Watch deployment will be finished so that the Black Watch is back in time for
               Christmas. It is not anticipated that the Scots Guards will replace the Black Watch
               in the job that it is doing at the present time.</seg>
            <seg> </seg>
            <seg>I also entirely agree that the important thing is to ensure that the democratic
               elections in Iraq go ahead. As I think we saw with Afghanistan, what happens in the
               course of the movement towards democracy is that some of those people who were
               anti-democratic forces end up on the defensive because people can see that there is a
               democratic process they can take part in. The power of some warlords in Afghanistan
               was broken not in the two years after the invasion, but in the few months running up
               to the democratic elections. The decision in respect of Falluja was taken by the
               Iraqi Government. It is really important that people understand this. Prime Minister
               Allawi made it very clear when he was appointed by the United Nations—endorsed by the
               United Nations—back in June that decisions of this nature were for him. Anyone who
               heard his press conference today, including his description of exactly how those
               terrorists and insurgents are using hospitals, schools, mosques and other places to
               store explosives and to try to ensure that in removing them there is the maximum
               damage done, could hear from his statement how passionately he believes that this is
               important. I understand that the decision has also been endorsed by the National
               Assembly. The very fear that he and others have is that if these terrorists and
               insurgents are allowed to carry on effectively making no-go areas in Iraq for the
               Iraqi Government, the issue of elections will be made more difficult.</seg>
            <seg>That brings me to the UN and the Secretary-General's letter. He said in that letter
               that the Iraqi elections are what he called, I think, the keystone of progress in
               Iraq. That is true. It is true also that he went on to express reservations about the
               action in Falluja, but as Prime Minister Allawi says, without the action in Falluja
               the keystone of the democratic process may be at risk. That is the important reason
               for doing it.</seg>
            <seg>I think the Secretary-General is right also in saying it is important that we
               retain the moral high ground in fighting for elections in Iraq, but I say this to him
               and to others: part of us doing that is to keep emphasising the whole time to people
               that if the terrorists and insurgents would stop, elections would go forward. There
               would be full participation by Sunnis and others in those elections. Everyone wants
               that to happen. If the terrorism and insurgency stopped, there would be no need for
               American and British and other countries' troops to help the Iraqi forces before they
               are able to look after Iraq on their own.</seg>
            <seg>The truth of the matter is that it is the terrorism that keeps troops from America,
               Britain and elsewhere there. If it stopped, of course, the Iraqi Government would be
               able to assume control of those areas, the UN-sponsored elections would take place
               and we would have a democratically elected Government. That is why I say to people
               that the absolutely critical argument to understand is that these terrorists are not
               fighting foreign troops because of their presence - they are fighting them because
               they are an obstacle to preventing democratic elections. They know that if democratic
               elections happen, people will never give up democracy.</seg>
            <seg>In Afghanistan, turnout was highest among women, and highest in the areas where the
               Taliban used to hold sway. It is obvious from the past few weeks, I am afraid, that
               the terrorists have an increasingly sophisticated strategy, in relation to how they
               operate, what they say and how they play the modern media. They are trying to ensure
               that they focus attention not on their attempt to prevent democracy but on the
               presence of foreign forces in Iraq, when they know perfectly well that those forces
               would leave if only the terrorism stopped. In respect of Iran, the Americans, France,
               Germany and the UK take the same line: we have all made it clear that it is not
               acceptable for Iran to acquire nuclear weapons capability. It should come into
               compliance with the International Atomic Energy Agency. We are trying to put maximum
               pressure on it to do that. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman would endorse that
               strategy, which we all endorse.</seg>
            <seg>In respect of the European Parliament, I sort of agree with what the right hon.
               Gentleman says. In respect of a smaller Commission, I entirely agree with what he
               says—in time, I think that that is important. We have made it clear that we will have
               a referendum on the EU constitution. As for combining that with one on the euro, we
               have always made it clear that membership of the single currency must be decided on
               the basis of the economic tests, and that remains the case.</seg>

               there not siren voices in the Council indicating that competition between the
               European Union and the United States was a better policy than competition and
               collaboration? Will he not reiterate that that transatlantic co-operation and

               another reason why it is important for Britain to stay part of the European Union and
               a key player in Europe. It cannot be stressed too often that many countries around
               the table in Europe—let us remember that 12 out of the 25 have troops in Iraq—are

               Falluja by mainly Shi'a militia, under cover of American firepower, far from making
               it more likely that there will be peaceful elections there in January, will prove

               The terrorists are trying to cause maximum difficulty, which is why they are taking
               over places such as hospitals, schools and mosques. That is the reason why the

               been making every effort to get a peaceful settlement in Falluja. That included
               making it clear that, provided that Iraqi Government forces came in and took control
               in Falluja, there would be no need for multinational forces to be in there, and it
               included ensuring that it was realised that there would be municipal elections in
               Falluja. The problem that we now have, however, is that unless we take back control

               progress, but we are doing everything that we can to limit civilian casualties in the

               that those who support terrorists and insurgents are in breach of their moral
               obligations to the international community.</seg>

            <seg>The surrender of Britain's veto on asylum and immigration policy in favour of
               qualified majority voting forms part of the European constitution. That being the
               case, why is the Prime Minister taking the decision to give up the veto now? Can he
               not wait for the referendum, when the British people will be able to vote on the
               constitution?</seg>

            <seg>, but it is not the case. We are not giving up the absolute right to decide whether
               to opt in to any asylum or immigration measure, and that is very sensible. There are
               certain issues—for example, as I said a moment ago, people trafficking and illegal
               immigration—on which we want to be part of European action. However, we can decide
               those issues one by one. As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary rightly said, it
               is the best of both worlds. The hon. Gentleman probably represents the mainstream
               view in the Conservative party today. It is not really about opting in or opting out,
               or this veto or that veto. What he and his colleagues want is a fundamental
               restructuring of Britain's existing relationship with the European Union</seg>
