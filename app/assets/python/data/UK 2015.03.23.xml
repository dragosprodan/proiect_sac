      <body>
         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>I know that the whole House will join me in welcoming David Natzler as the new
               Clerk of the House. Mr Speaker, you went to the ends of the earth in search of the
               best candidate, but I am glad that we found the right answer right here in Britain.
               Before turning to the main focus of the Council, which was the situation in the
               eurozone, let me say a word about the discussions on Tunisia and Libya, on the
               situation in Ukraine and on the nuclear talks with Iran. I am sure the whole House
               will join me in sending our deepest condolences to the friends and family of Sally
               Adey, a British holidaymaker who was among at least 20 tourists and two Tunisians
               brutally murdered in the terrorist attack at the Bardo museum last week. I have
               written to President Essebsi to assure him that Britain will stand with the people of
               Tunisia as they seek to defeat the terrorists and build a peaceful and prosperous
               future. The EU has agreed to offer practical assistance, and Britain will play its
               part, deploying SO15 and military counter-terrorism experts and continuing to provide
               assistance in aviation security and tourist resort protection. The suggestion that
               some of the terrorists involved had been trained in Libya is the latest evidence of
               the very difficult situation in that country. The Council agreed on the need for a
               political solution, supporting UN-led efforts to bring the different parties in Libya
               together to agree a national unity Government. Britain has provided Libya with aid
               and military training, and we will continue to do all that we can to assist. I know
               that some people are looking at this situation and asking whether Britain, France and
               America were right to act to stop Colonel Gaddafi when we did. We should be clear
               that the answer is yes. Gaddafi was on the brink of massacring his own people in
               Benghazi, and we prevented what would have been a wide-scale, brutal, murderous
               assault. It was the right thing to do, and we should be very proud of the British
               servicemen and women who carried out that vital task. Turning to the situation in
               eastern Ukraine, the Council welcomed the significant reduction in fighting and the
               progress on the withdrawal of heavy weapons. But as President Obama, President
               Hollande, Chancellor Merkel and I agreed earlier this month, it is essential to send
               a clear signal that sanctions will not be eased until Russia delivers on its promises
               and the Minsk agreements are fully implemented. The European Council did exactly
               that. The conclusions say that <quote>the duration of the restrictive
                  measures...should be clearly linked to the complete implementation of the Minsk
                  Agreements.</quote> The conclusions also underline our readiness to take further
               measures if required. One of the best things we can do to help Russias neighbours is
               to help them to fight corruption and strengthen their democracies. Just as the
               Know-How fund, set up by Margaret Thatcher, did a great job of helping eastern
               European countries after the fall of the Berlin wall, so we need the same approach
               today. At the Council, I announced a good governance fund with an initial 20 million
               to support reforms in countries in the eastern neighbourhood and the western Balkans.
               This will complement support from other donors, accelerating efforts to fight
               corruption, strengthening the rule of law, reforming the police and justice systems
               and supporting free markets by liberalising key sectors such as energy and banking.
               The fund will be up and running by the summer. As well as covering Ukraine, it will
               initially cover Georgia, Moldova, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Turning to
               Iran, I met Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande in the margins of the Council to
               discuss progress in the vital talks on Irans nuclear programme. We are absolutely
               clear and united in our purpose. Iran must never be allowed to develop a nuclear
               weapon. But there is a peaceful path to civil nuclear energy, and we believe that a
               comprehensive, durable and verifiable deal is possible, but only if Iran shows
               greater flexibility and takes some tough decisions during the talks this week. We
               also discussed proposals for co-ordinating Europes energy policy, ensuring
               transparency of gas supply agreements and that Europes energy policies are consistent
               with reaching the vital deal at the climate change summit in Paris this December.
               Turning to the eurozone, the Council welcomed the agreement between Greece and the
               euro area to extend their programme. Let me say again - this is the last of these
               statements in this Parliament and I have probably uttered this sentence 11 times:
               Britain is not in the eurozone and we are not going to join the eurozone. But we do
               need the eurozone to work properly. A disorderly Greek exit from the euro remains a
               major threat to Europes economic stability and it could be very damaging to the
               British economy. Protecting our economy from these wider risks in the eurozone means
               sticking to this Governments long-term economic plan. Five years ago, Britains
               economy was close to the edge. We had the biggest budget deficit in our peacetime
               history. We had a deficit that was forecast to be bigger than that of Greece or of
               any other developed country on the planet. Five years on, the deficit has been halved
               and our national debt is falling as a share of GDP; we have the fastest growth of any
               major western economy; we have 1.89 million more people in work; and we have more
               jobs created in Yorkshire than in the whole of France, and more jobs created in the
               UK than in the rest of the European Union put together. We need to stay on this path,
               not abandon it just as it is leading our country to prosperity. Just as we are acting
               in our national interest at home, so we have acted to protect our national interest
               in Europe, too: we have cut the EU budget for the first time in its history; we got
               Britain out of the euro bail-out schemes; we vetoed a treaty that was not in our
               national interest; we stopped attempts to discriminate against EU countries outside
               the eurozone, not least with our successful legal challenge last month; we have made
               vital progress on cutting red tape and completing the single market; at our G8 in
               Lough Erne, we kick-started the talks on what will be the biggest bilateral trade
               deal in history, between the EU and the US; we have put power back in the hands of
               our fishermen so they can sell what they catch; we have negotiated a new single
               European patent that will reduce cost for entrepreneurs, and part of that patent
               court will be based right here in London; we have ensured new safeguards to protect
               our vital financial services industry; we have returned over 100 powers from Brussels
               to Britain, giving us more control over our borders, policing and security; we have
               clamped down on benefit tourism; and in foreign policy, we have worked with our
               European partners to get things done and keep our people safe, on matters ranging
               from sanctions on Russia and Iran, and practical assistance to help countries in
               north Africa fight terrorism, to international action to help those in desperate need
               around the world, including in west Africa, where British aid workers are risking
               their lives, helping to stop the spread of Ebola. In the coming two years, we have
               the opportunity to reform the EU and fundamentally change Britains relationship with
               it. We have the opportunity to build a European Union that is more competitive, more
               flexible and more accountable to the people, where powers flow back to member states,
               not just away from them, and where freedom of movement is no longer an unqualified
               right. And for the first time in 40 years, we have the opportunity to give the
               British people their say on Britains place in Europe with an in-out referendum. If I
               am Prime Minister, that is what I will do. Those who would refuse to give the British
               people their say should explain themselves to this House and to the country. I
               commend this statement to the House.</seg>
         </u>
         <u who="#MILIBAND-EDWARD">
            <seg>May I thank the Prime Minister for his statement? He is obviously getting in his
               preparations for opposition now. Let me also join him in congratulating David Natzler
               on his very well-deserved appointment. I also wish to join the Prime Minister in
               condemning the appalling terrorist attack in Tunisia last week. Our thoughts go out
               to the family and friends of Sally Adey and all the victims who were involved in the
               attacks. This despicable act of terrorism once again reinforces our determination to
               stand united across Europe. Before turning to other matters, I also want to note that
               since the last European Council we have had the Israeli elections, although they do
               not appear to have been discussed at the European Council. Let me say that there is
               now one overriding priority, which is restarting negotiations towards a two-state
               solution: a secure Israel alongside a viable Palestinian state. Can the Prime
               Minister, when he replies, say whether he agrees that we must put pressure on both
               sides now to restart negotiations? In the light of Prime Minister Netanyahus comments
               in the run-up to the election, has our Prime Minister sought reassurances about his
               continuing commitment to a two-state solution? On Iran, we support the talks. We
               cannot allow an Iran with nuclear weapons. It is vital that we secure a successful
               outcome and we will support the EU in seeking to bring that about. Let me also echo
               the Prime Ministers words on Libya. We supported the military action - it was the
               right thing to do - and we support the call for an immediate and unconditional
               ceasefire. However, the Prime Minister needs to tell the country why things have gone
               so wrong in Libya. Are people not entitled to conclude that the international
               community did not adequately plan for the aftermath of the conflict, and what does he
               realistically believe can be done now? On Greece, rather than recycling his failing
               election slogans, can the Prime Minister tell us what the prospects are for a
               long-term agreement with Greece? That agreement is in the interests of Greece, the
               eurozone, and the United Kingdom. Turning to the situation in Ukraine, it is vital
               that the international community stands united in ensuring that the Minsk agreement
               is implemented in full. We welcome the commitment, which the Prime Minister
               reiterated, that EU sanctions on Russia should be eased only in the event of the full
               implementation of that agreement. Given that the current situation on the ground is
               not showing signs of getting better, will the Prime Minister tell us whether
               discussions took place during the summit about increasing further the pressure on
               Russia, particularly on the so-called tier 3 sanctions on specific sectors? It is
               clear that the security dimension of the EU is becoming more and more important. That
               has been particularly apparent over the past year. It demands common action, resolve
               and a clear commitment to our continuing place in the European Union - a commitment
               that the Prime Minister is incapable of delivering. As this is his 29th and last
               European statement, I had hoped that he might do what he has failed to do in the past
               28 and spell out his negotiating strategy. All we had was the same empty rhetoric.
               Perhaps he can now specifically tell us what the non-negotiable reforms are that he
               is seeking in Europe. Is he seeking treaty change? Would he countenance voting for
               out in a referendum</seg>

            <seg>Oh, the Minister for Europe says no from a sedentary position; he would not
               countenance supporting out. Perhaps, when the Prime Minister replies, he can confirm
               that the Minister for Europe said from a sedentary position that, under no
               circumstances, would he countenance an out vote in a referendum - the Minister knows
               that the national interest lies in staying in. Those are the questions to which the
               country deserves answers. Was the Prime Minister disappointed last week when the
               President of the European Council, who is supposedly an ally of Britain, described
               his position as <quote>mission impossible</quote>? With the typical modesty that we

               to the Prime Minister that I am not sure that that is the main difference that comes
               to mind. One has a consistent and relatively coherent approach to international
               affairs and the other is the Prime Minister of Britain.</seg>
            <seg>The Prime Minister mentioned his achievements. Let us remind ourselves of them. He
               talked about his veto of the treaty, but the treaty went ahead. He did not mention
               the stand he took against President Juncker; he lost that 26 votes to two. He did not
               mention either the 1.7 billion bill from Brussels. His attitude to that was: cant
               pay, wont pay, oh, all right, we will pay. But let me relay my personal favourite
               over the past five years. Who can forget his phrase that in this town, you need to

            <seg>I had not been counting, but I think that reporting back to the House 29 times is
               quite an impressive record - too many. The right hon. Gentleman does have one thing
               in common with Tom Cruise: every policy he touches self-destructs in five
               secondstuition fees, spending, the deficit, taxes; it is all the same. Let me deal
               with the right hon. Gentlemans questions. On the very important matter of the Israeli
               elections, I am sure that we will all want to congratulate Prime Minister Netanyahu
               on his election victory. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that we must put
               pressure on both sides to ensure that talks on a two-state solution get going. I will
               be talking with Prime Minister Netanyahu this evening, and I will make it very clear
               that I support a two-state solution. I think that is in the long-term interests of
               not only the Palestinians, but the Israelis, and Britains policy on that will not
               change. I thank the right hon. Gentleman for what he said in support of the
               Governments position on Iran and on Libya. He asked why we have seen the difficulties
               after the fall of Gaddafi. One of the things that we have to be clear about is that
               the Libyan people and the Libyan Government did not want some occupying force; they
               did not want to be remotely controlled by others. They were given opportunities to
               opt for a more unified future, but so far they have not taken them, so we have to do
               everything we can to keep putting those options on the table, not least through a
               national unity Government. The right hon. Gentleman asked about Greece and the
               prospects for a long-term agreement. I still think that the prospects are quite
               worrying, because on one hand we have the creditor nations that want to see Greece
               fulfil its programme, and on the other hand we have a Greek Government who do not
               seem at the moment to be coming up with reforms that give their creditors confidence.
               One of the lessons that needs to be learned - the right hon. Gentleman needs to learn
               this - is that government involves difficult decisions, and the Greeks still have to
               make difficult decisions.</seg>

            <seg>Yes, he was in government. I remember, because he completely crashed the economy,
               as a member of the Government who left this country in hopeless amounts of debt. The
               right hon. Gentleman asked a very specific question on the Minsk agreement: will
               there be more sanctions if there is more destabilisation? The answer is yes. We
               should be prepared to consider more sanctions if the situation deteriorates. The key
               point about the Minsk agreement is that the difficult decisions for Russia will come
               at the end of the process, which is why it is so important to keep the sanctions
               right to the end. The right hon. Gentleman wants to know why we want to renegotiate
               in Europe, and I will tell him why: we want to get out of ever-closer union; we do
               not want that to apply to Britain; we want control of our welfare system; we want
               safeguards for the single market; we want powers to flow back to Britain. Let me ask
               him this: if those are the things that we want, what is it that he wants? The answer,
               when it comes to Europe, is absolutely nothing. He told us that he does not think
               that Brussels has too much power. He refuses to rule out joining the euro because, as
               he said, <quote>It depends how long Im Prime Minister for</quote>, so that is a
               hopeful message.</seg>
            <seg>He has made it clear that he will never give the British people a say in a
               referendum. Frankly, I will compare my record on Europe with his partys every day of
               the week. They gave away 7 billion of the rebate; we have protected the rebate. They
               gave away our ability to veto what is not in our national interest; we vetoed a
               treaty that was not in our national interest. They signed Britain up to being in the
               euro bail-out fund; we got Britain out of the euro bail-out fund. The truth is that
               we on the Government side of the House stand up for Britain in Europe and the Labour

               Britain by getting out of the bail-out fund. We have returned 100 specific powers as
               a result of the opt-out on justice and home affairs. I have been very specific that
               when it comes to the free movement of people, and particularly its interaction with
               our welfare system, we need powers to be returned to this country. Specifically, I
               have said that people coming from European Union countries to Britain should not be
               allowed to claim unemployment benefit, that they should have to leave after six
               months if they do not have a job, that they should have to pay in for four years
               before getting anything out of the tax credits system and that they should not be
               able to send child benefit or other child tax payments to families back home. Those
               things require serious change in Europe, including treaty change, and that is what we

            <seg>First, just in case it is the last time I look at the right hon. Gentleman across
               the Floor of the House of Commons and he does not catch the Speakers eye at the last
               Prime Ministers questions on Wednesday, may I pay tribute to him for all the work
               that he has done in government and in opposition, including in some very senior roles
               at some very difficult times for this country? The one pledge I make him is that if
               he continues to live where he does, his constituency MP will always stand up for him
               in this House of Commons and make sure that he receives a premium service. The two
               points that the right hon. Gentleman makes about Israel are right and they are points
               that I will be happy to make. They are linked: if there is no two-state solution, the
               situation ends up moving towards a one-state solution, which I think will be
               disastrous for the Jewish people in Israel, so I really do believe in the two-state
               solution. We are very much opposed to the settlement building that has taken place.
               We have been very clear about that and will continue to be clear about that. It makes
               a two-state solution more difficult and that, in turn, will make Israel less stable,

               country that was raising this problem was Austria, which has 60 of these agreements

               in free trade and backing Britains exporters. There are so many areas where we are
               disadvantaged in our trade with America and where we could be creating jobs and
               growth, but instead Labour Members want to read out a script handed to them by the
               trade unions to oppose the trade deal. It makes you weep for the time when the Labour
               party was in favour of progress and trade.</seg>

               un-British, in that the Crown Prosecution Service is seeking to neuter the abilities

               the point that we will make every day from now and for the next 45 days, which is

               freedom of movement was about accepting a job that had been offered, rather than
               simply the freedom to move to look for work. I have been clear, and we will be clear
               on the doorsteps, including in the hon. Gentlemans constituency: no unemployment
               benefit for visiting EU migrants; after six months if someone has no job they have to
               go home; someone must work for four years before they get in-work benefits; and no

            <seg>I absolutely understand and share the concerns that people right across the world,

               keep Iran away from having a nuclear weapon, with proper inspection and verification
               so that if there were any changes to those circumstances, they could be seen.
               Obviously, we should not do a deal at any price, but the alternatives to doing a deal
               are not attractive. Frankly, they are not attractive for Iran. The sanctions we put
               in place - Britain led the charge in Europe - have done such damage in Iran that it

               shows that the European Union will be making a very serious contribution to reducing
               carbon emissions. We obviously had to allow some countries, such as Poland, some
               flexibility, but the overall numbers for Europe are impressive. Now what we need to
               do, with the movement by the Americans and the Chinese, is discuss the matter with
               all the countries which might, if we are not careful, put a spoke in the wheel of
