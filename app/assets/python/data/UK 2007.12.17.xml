         <u who="#BROWN">
            <seg>With permission, I would like to make a statement about the European
               Council held in Brussels on 14 December. It focused on two major concerns: first, the
               reforms that Europe must make to meet and master the global challenges we face with
               competitiveness, employment, secure energy and climate change; and, secondly, issues
               of security, in particular in Kosovo, Iran and Burma, that we must confront
               together.</seg>
            <seg>I start with the most immediate concern facing the summit: the best way to bring
               about a satisfactory resolution to the status of Kosovo. Kosovo is the last remaining
               unresolved issue from the violent break-up of the former Yugoslavia, and in the light
               of recent failures by the parties in the Troika process to find a negotiated way
               forward, the European Council accepted its responsibility for joint European action
               and agreed the importance of urgently moving towards a settlement. It is to the
               credit of all parties in the dispute that, even when faced with conflicting
               positions, the region remains at peace. As the European Council conclusions noted, it
               is essential that this commitment to peace is maintained. </seg>
            <seg>The principles of our approach are, first, that Europe take seriously its special
               responsibility for the stability and security of the Balkans region. Indeed, it is
               also thanks to the sustained efforts of NATO troops and the diplomacy of the United
               Nations and the European Union that a safe and secure environment has been
               maintained. Secondly, however, we were agreed that the status quo is unsustainable
               and that we needed to move towards a settlement that ensures what the European
               Council called a <quote>"stable, democratic, multi-ethnic Kosovo committed to the
                  rule of law, and to the protection of minorities and of cultural and religious
                  heritage".</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>Thirdly, after a detailed discussion at the Council, we were also wholly united in
               agreeing that European engagement should move to a new level. We agreed in principle
               and stated our readiness to deploy a European security and defence policy policing
               and rule-of-law mission to Kosovo. That will consist of a multinational mission of
               around 1,800 policemen and judicial officials, of whom I can confirm that the UK will
               contribute around 80, including its deputy head, Roy Reeve. European Foreign
               Ministers will confirm the detailed arrangements for this mission shortly.</seg>
            <seg>Fourthly, we also reaffirmed that a stable and prosperous Serbia fully integrated
               into Europe is important for the stability of the region. The Council encouraged
               Serbia to meet the necessary conditions to allow signature of its stabilisation and
               association agreement with the EU and we expressed our confidence that Serbia has the
               capacity to make rapid progress subsequently towards candidate status. The
               conclusions of the meeting of European Foreign Ministers also reiterated the European
               Unions support for enlargement more generally. We look forward to recognising the
               progress made by both Croatia and Turkey at this weeks accession conference in
               Brussels.</seg>
            <seg>The UN Security Council will discuss the issue of Kosovo with representatives from
               both Belgrade and Pristina on 19 December. The aim is to give Russia an opportunity
               to accept a consensus on the way forward.</seg>
            <seg>If that proves impossible, we - Britain - have always been clear that the
               comprehensive proposal put forward by the UN special envoy, based on supervised
               independence for Kosovo, represents the best way forward. While we are rightly
               focused on the immediate priority of bringing the status process through to
               completion in an orderly and managed way, the European Council also agreed that it is
               important that we address the long-term challenge of ensuring Kosovos future economic
               and political viability. I welcome the commitment made by the European Union, to
               assist Kosovos economic and political development, for a donors conference to follow
               shortly after a status settlement.</seg>
            <seg>The Council also discussed Iran. There was agreement on a united European approach.
               Again, the power we wield working together with all the European Union is greater
               than if we act on our own. I have made it clear repeatedly that Iran remains in
               breach of its international obligations. In September, Foreign Ministers agreed that
               unless there were positive outcomes from Solana and the International Atomic Energy
               Agencys discussions with Iran, we would seek tougher sanctions at the UN. The latest
               assessment is that sufficient progress has not been made.</seg>
            <seg>The European Council conclusions call on Iran to provide full, clear and credible
               answers to the IAEA, and to resolve all questions concerning its nuclear activities.
               We reiterated our support for a new UN resolution as soon as possible, and agreed to
               decide on new measures that the EU might have to take to resolve the situation at the
               January meeting of Foreign Ministers. Those should complement UN measures, and not
               substitute for them if the Security Council cannot reach agreement.</seg>
            <seg>Iran has a choice: confrontation with the international community leading to a
               tightening of sanctions; or, if it changes its approach, a transformed relationship
               with the world from which all would benefit. The EU also reaffirmed its deep concern
               about the unacceptable situation in Burma, and made it clear that if there is no
               change in the Burmese regimes approach to political negotiations and basic political
               freedoms, we stand ready to review, amend andif necessaryfurther reinforce
               restrictive measures against the Burmese Government. We also reaffirmed the important
               role of China, India and the Association of South East Asian Nations in actively
               supporting the UNs efforts to establish an inclusive political process leading to
               genuine national reconciliation.</seg>
            <seg>For our part we believe that the forthcoming visit of Professor Gambari, the UN
               envoy, is critical. It is essential that the Burmese Government meet the demands set
               out in the UN Security Council statement: to release all political prisoners; to
               create the conditions for political dialogue, including relaxation of restrictions on
               Aung San Suu Kyi; to allow full co-operation with Gambari; to address human rights
               concerns; and to begin a genuine and inclusive process of dialogue and national
               reconciliation with the opposition. In particular, the regime should respond to the
               constructive statement of Aung San Suu Kyi on 8 November and open a meaningful
               dialogue with the opposition and the countrys ethnic groups. The Council also agreed
               that a key part of the EUs external agenda is how we can, by working together,
               maximise our influence in tackling global poverty. The European Commission should
               report by April next year - halfway to the 2015 millennium goals date - on how the EU
               is meeting its commitments to those goals, and how we can accelerate further
               progress.</seg>
            <seg>In addition to those issues of international security and development, the Council
               conclusions and the special declaration on globalisation set out the challenges that
               the European Union must address on globalisation. We agreed to maintain our focus on
               economic reform, with a renewed focus on modernising the single market so that it
               enhances Europes ability to compete in the global economy. We must have full
               implementation of the services directive by 2009. We must continue to work towards
               further liberalisation in energy, post and telecoms, where market opening could
               generate between 75 billion and 95 billion of extra benefits and contribute 360,000
               jobs. Investment in research, innovation and educationand removing barriers to
               enterpriseare also essential.</seg>
            <seg>We reaffirmed our commitment to free trade and openness, and the priority of
               securing a successful Doha world trade round, which would lead to benefits
               approaching $200 billion, bringing significant benefits to rich and poor countries
               alike. We will also propose and support better EU-USA trade links.</seg>
            <seg>We agreed, too, to do more to develop mechanisms for co-operation within the EU to
               tackle issues such as security challenges in relation to terrorism, illegal
               immigration and organised crime. We renewed our commitment to the EU
               counter-terrorism strategy and to co-operation on counter-radicalisation work. We
               will work together to deliver our commitments to tackling climate change, including
               the target of a reduction in emissions. Building on the significant progress made in
               Bali last weekan agreement on which the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and
               Rural Affairs will report to the House tomorrowwe must help to negotiate an ambitious
               post-2012 international climate change agreement. We agreed that Europe must also
               step up funding, including funding through the World Bank, to help the developing
               world to shift to lower carbon growth and adapt to climate change. </seg>
            <seg>It was agreed at the last Council meeting that the presidency would propose the
               establishment of a new reflection group. That was announced in October. At this later
               meeting, the Council invited Mr. Felipe Gonzalez Marquez, assisted by two
               vice-chairs, Mrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga and Mr. Jorma Ollila, Chairman of Shell and
               Nokia, to <quote>"identify the key issues and developments which the Union is likely
                  to face in 2020 or 2030 and to analyse how these might be addressed".</quote> The
               remit states specifically that <quote>"it shall not discuss institutional matters.
                  Nor should its analysis constitute a review of current policies or address the
                  Union's next financial framework"?.</quote> The group will report back to the
               Council, which will decide how to follow its recommendations.</seg>
            <seg>I can also tell the House that today we are publishing the European Union
               (Amendment) Bill, which contains the institutional changes to accommodate a Europe of
               27 members, and will include the safeguards that we have negotiated to protect the
               British national interest. They consist of the legally binding protocol which ensures
               that nothing in the charter of fundamental rights challenges or undermines the rights
               already set out in UK law, and that nothing in the charter extends the ability of any
               court, European or national, to strike down UK law; legally binding protocols which
               prescribe in detail our sovereign right to opt in on individual justice and home
               affairs measures when we consider doing so to be in the British interest, but
               alternatively to remain outside if that is in our interests; a declaration that
               expressly states that nothing in the new treaty affects the existing powers of member
               states to formulate and conduct their foreign policy, and that the basis of foreign
               and security policy will remain intergovernmental, a matter for Governments to decide
               on the basis of unanimity; and an effective power of veto on any proposals for
               important changes on social security, so that when we - Britain - determine that any
               proposal would have an impact on an important aspect of our social security system,
               including its scope, cost or financial structure, we can insist on taking any
               proposal to the European Council under the unanimity provision.</seg>
            <seg>With the publication of the Bill, Parliament will now have an opportunity to debate
               this amending treaty in detail and decide whether to implement it. We will ensure
               that there is sufficient time for debate on the Floor of the House, so that the Bill
               can be examined in the fullest detail and all points of view can be heard. That will
               give the House the fullest possible opportunity to consider the treaty, and the deal
               secured for the UK, before ratification.</seg>
            <seg>In addition, I can tell the House that we have built into the legislation further
               safeguards to ensure that there is proper parliamentary oversight and accountability.
               So that no Government can agree without Parliament's approval to any changes in
               European rules that could in any way alter the constitutional balance of power
               between Britain and the European Union, there is a provision in the Bill that any
               proposal to activate the mechanisms in the treaty which provide for further moves to
               qualified majority voting but which require unanimitythe so-called passerelleswill
               have to be subject to a prior vote by the House. In the event of a negative vote, the
               Government would refuse to allow the use of the passerelle. The Bill also includes a
               statutory obligation that any future amendments to the treaty, including amendments
               that provided for any increase in the EU's competence, would have to be ratified
               through an Act of Parliament; so Parliament would have absolute security that no
               future change could be made against its wishes.</seg>
            <seg>I said in October that we would oppose any further institutional change in the
               relationship between the EU and its member states, not just for this Parliament but
               for the next, and I stand by that commitment. This is now also the settled consensus
               of the EU. All 27 member states agreed at the Counciland it was expressly set out in
               the conclusionsthat this amending treaty provides the Union with a stable and lasting
               institutional framework, and that it completes the process of institutional reform
               for the foreseeable future. The conclusions of the Council state specifically that
                  <quote>"the amending treaty provides the Union with a stable and lasting
                  institutional framework. We expect no change in the foreseeable
               future".</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>Let me conclude with the discussion on the most immediate of economic issues
               discussed: concerns about the economic consequences of the global financial
               turbulence that started in America in August. The Government's first priority in the
               coming weeks is to ensure the stability of the economy and to have the strength to
               take the difficult long-term decisions necessary. The Council agreed that the whole
               of the EU must now turn its attention to both the immediate measures necessary and
               the long-term strengthening of international capacity to secure greater financial
               stability. The announcement earlier this week by central banks in the major financial
               centres that they will provide liquidity to ease tension in the financial markets
               must now be built upon.</seg>
            <seg>As we agreed, supervisory authorities in different countries need to co-operate
               effectively across borders in exchanging information and in the management of
               contagion. The European Council conclusions emphasised that macro-economic
               fundamentals in the EU are strong and that sustained economic growth is expected, but
               we concluded that continued monitoring of financial markets and the economy is
               crucial, as uncertainties remain. The Council underlined the importance of work being
               taken forward both within the EU and with our international partners to improve
               transparency for investors, markets and regulators; to improve valuation standards;
               to improve the prudential framework, risk management and supervision in the financial
               sector; and to review the functioning of markets, including the role of credit rating
               agencies.</seg>
            <seg>The European Council will discuss these issues at its spring 2008 meeting on the
               basis of a progress report from the Council of Finance Ministers and the financial
               stability forum. As agreed by Chancellor Merkel, President Sarkozy and I in October,
               the progress report should examine whether regulatory or other action is necessary. I
               have invited Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy to London so that we can discuss
               the proposals in the paper we agreed and issued a few weeks agomeasures important to
               strengthening the international community's role in addressing financial turbulence,
               showing the importance we attach to taking the long-term decisions to ensure in
               testing times the stability of the economy.</seg>
            <seg>The conclusions of the Council state specifically that in the institutional
               framework we expect no change for the foreseeable future. The protections that have
               been agreed in the amending treaty defend the British national interest. In the Bill
               introduced today, we are legislating for new protections and new procedures to lock
               in our protection of these interests. Europe is now moving to a new agenda, one that
               focuses on the changes needed to meet the challenges of the global era. I commend the
               statement to the House.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>I thank the Prime Minister for his statement on the European Council
               in Brussels. I note that he could not bring himself to mention his visit to Lisbon. I
               am delighted that the Government have finally adopted our position of saying that
               Europe should focus on the real issues and not on institutional reform. However, the
               whole country will ask how he can possibly say that, having just signed up to an
               all-encompassing constitution that transfers powers from Westminster to Brussels and
               when he will not even put the constitution, with its massive institutional changes,
               to the British people in a referendum.</seg>
            <seg>Before turning to the constitution, let me ask about those areas where decisive
               action is needed: the Balkans, Iran and Darfur. On Burma, I very much agree with what
               the Prime Minister said. On the Balkans, clear signals are needed. Kosovo should not
               be left in limbo, no other border should be reopened and military reserves should be
               deployed to demonstrate Europes resolve. In terms of sending out these clear signals,
               does the Prime Minister agree that if Serbia wants to join the EU, she should
               co-operate fully with the war crimes tribunal, which means arresting Mladic and
               Karadzic and getting them to The Hague?</seg>
            <seg>On Iran, what is needed is a combination of engagement and sanctions. We have
               consistently argued that although the United States needs to do more in terms of
               engagement, Europe needs to do much more in terms of sanctions. What progress was
               made in Brussels in persuading other European countries that new export credits
               should be banned and that access for certain Iranian banks to the European financial
               system should be restricted?</seg>
            <seg>On Darfur, which I do not think he mentioned, the Prime Minister said three months
               ago that more than 20,000 troops and police were necessary. I agree. Today there are
               still fewer than 10,000. When will that shortfall be made up?</seg>
            <seg>Turning to the constitution, I have to say to the Prime Minister that the key issue
               is the referendum. Is it not the case that he simply will not restore trust in
               politics unless he keeps his promise to hold one? Labour Members of Parliament -
               staggeringly few of them are here today - put that commitment to a referendum in
               their election addresses, trade unionists voted for it in the TUC, and every opinion
               poll shows that it is what people want. This issue is not going to go away. In trying
               to justify breaking his promise, the Prime Minister says that this treaty is not the
               constitution, but does he not understand that that simply will not wash? The German
               Chancellor, the Irish Prime Minister and the Spanish Foreign Minister all completely
               undermine what the Prime Minister says by saying that the treaty is pretty much the
               same as the constitution, and the author of the constitution, Giscard dEstaing, said
               last month that the constitutions <quote>"essential points... reappear word for word
                  in the new project. Not a comma has changed!"</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>The Prime Ministers argument has simply collapsed. Does he not see that it is this
               sort of approach that makes him look shifty and untrustworthy? Does he not see that
               far from getting him out of his troubles, denying people a referendum is digging him
               in deeper? This treaty obviously is the constitution. It contains an EU President, a
               Foreign Minister and an EU diplomatic service, and it gets rid of the veto in 60
               areas and contains a new ratchet clause which allows even more vetoes to be scrapped
               without a new intergovernmental conference. When I put that point to the Prime
               Minister last October, he claimed the measure was already there in the Single
               European Act. It was not. The new clause for the first time allows virtually any veto
               to be scrapped in any area. That measure was not in the Single European Act, nor in
               any treaty before this one. Once again, the Prime Minister is treating people like
               fools.</seg>
            <seg>So the Prime Minister has not been straight about the constitution, and that was
               only made worse by his frankly bizarre performance in Lisbon last week. Was he going
               or was he not going? Was he going to sign the treaty or was he not going to sign the
               treaty? Were the cameras going to record it or not? He could not summon up the
               courage to decide.</seg>
            <seg>Is this not all a pattern for this Prime Minister? We get troop withdrawals that
               have already happened, the election that never was, and now the signing ceremony that
               would not take place. There was not a word in the statement about actually signing
               the treaty. I expect that Macavity hopes we have forgotten about it already. Did not
               a senior diplomat get it right when he said of the Prime Ministers dithering that
                  <quote>"he's ended up with the worst of all worlds... If he wants to send a
                  Euro-signal that hes indecisive, hes just sent it?" </quote>As for the Foreign
               Secretary, in all the past centuries of British Foreign Secretaries representing this
               country overseas, has there ever been a more ludicrous moment than this Foreign
               Secretary being so isolated and alone that the only person whose hand he could find
               to shake was the usher who had handed him the pen? Is it not the case that European
               leaders now see the Prime Minister in the same light as do the British people: not as
               the strong leader he posed as in July, but as a Prime Minister who has turned out to
               be weak, ditheringsecond-rate would be a bonus with himand not straight with people?
               Does he not recognise that the best chance he has got to redeem himself is to hold
               that referendum he promised?</seg>

         <u who="#BROWN">
            <seg>In the spirit of Christmas, let us find where we do agree. We agree on
               Kosovo, where our aim, too, is supervised independence, the arrest of the Serbian
               criminals, and to ensure that there is a proper civilian as well as military presence
               from both the EU and NATO on the ground. We agree on Iran: obviously, the right hon.
               Gentleman agrees with me that because the issue is enriched uranium, sanctions are
               necessary. We agree on Darfur, and I thank him for mentioning that as it gives me the
               chance to say that we are ready to step up both sanctions and activity in relation to
               Darfur if we do not get the co-operation of the Government there.</seg>
            <seg>As the right hon. Gentleman said, we also agree on Burma. However, I am surprised
               that when we are debating the issues that arose from the European Counciland I rather
               suspect he wrote his contribution before he looked at its conclusionshe does not
               mention the declaration on globalisation, the commitment to economic reform, what we
               have done on the environment together, and what we continue to do on the financial
               stability issues, none of which he seems to think important, because the only issue
               that obsesses the Conservative party is the European amending treaty. I have to ask
               him this question, then: if the Conservative party thinks that a referendum is so
               important, does it agree that even after ratification there would be a referendum?
               Some of the party think that there should be, but others think there should not. Will
               he tell us what his position is, because until he does so we will rightly say that he
               is all slogans and absolutely no substance?</seg>
            <seg>When it comes to the wording in the Bill that I have laid before the House today, I
               should correct the right hon. Gentleman. On passerelles, there will be a
               parliamentary vote on whether there should be any move from unanimity to qualified
               majority voting, and the Government will not be able to sign up to a passerelle
               change without the approval of the House of Commons. However, I have to tell him on
               the referendum issue that not one other countryexcept the Irish Republic, which is
               constitutionally bound to have a referendumis proposing to have that referendum. The
               Dutch and the Danish have rejected it. The right hon. Gentleman has only two
               supporters in the European Union as he tries to find a new group. The Bulgarian party
               has now deserted him, and the Czech party has said only in the last few days that it
               wants to sign the treaty. It is not a constitutional treaty in their view, and if
               they did not sign the treaty it would lead, they said, to the international isolation
               of the Czech Republic.</seg>
            <seg>That is the view of the right hon. Gentlemans best ally in Europe; and perhaps I
               should repeat to him what the chairman of his democracy commission has said about
               this matterthat a European referendum would be crackpot, dotty and frankly absurd. Is
               it not about time that the Conservatives faced up to the big issues in Europe; that
               they accepted they we are trying to move Europe to a new agenda; that they joined
               that new agenda, which is about the environment, the economy and security; and that
               they stopped their obsession with the issues of the past?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#CABLE">
            <seg>I too welcome the statement, particularly the Prime Ministers comments
               on Kosovo, Iran and Burma, and his support for economic reform and free trade. I
               start by referring to the meetings that he did not attend, before getting on to the
               one that he did. He was absolutely right not to attend the EU-Africa summit. The
               European Union has a travel ban on Mugabe, and the Prime Minister was absolutely
               right to take a principled stand on that. The only doubt that I am left with is why,
               given his strong position on human rights, he did not take a comparably strong
               position on the King of Saudi Arabia. I suspect that Mr. Mugabe will be wondering
               whether the only way to get on the right side of the Prime Ministers principled view
               of foreign policy is to have some oil.</seg>
            <seg>The other meeting that the Prime Minister did not attend, of course, was the
               signing ceremony, and I am puzzled about the reasons for that. Either he could not
               organise his diary, which would be incompetent, or he could not make the effort,
               which would be discourteous. Alternatively, he was trying to send the conflicting
               signal that he did not like the treaty that he had agreed to. Whether it was
               duplicity, incompetence or discourtesy, it reflected badly not just on him but on the
               country as a whole.</seg>
            <seg>There is one way for the Prime Minister to redeem himself, which is to call a
               referendum: not, of course, on the narrow issue of the treaty, but on the broader
               question of whether Britain should remain a full member of the European Unionan issue
               on which nobody under the age of 50 has yet had an opportunity to vote. Perhaps I
               might remind the Prime Minister of what happened when we had a vote in the House of
               Commons on 14 November. His party and mine were unitedon opposite sides of the
               argument. The Conservatives voted 149 against the referendum and six in favour, with
               31 abstaining. If high principle does not appeal to him, perhaps low politics will,
               and he will come round to the idea of a referendum.</seg>
            <seg>On the specifics of the Prime Ministers statement, he was right to draw attention
               to the progress made on Kyoto and climate change, but can he clarify exactly what
               this means for the commitments of the United Kingdom? I tackled him at Prime
               Ministers questions a few weeks ago on the UK commitment to a 20 per cent. renewables
               use by 2020, and he replied by saying that that was not a commitment for the UK, but
               for the European Union as a whole. Somewhat earlier, on 1 March, his Foreign
               Secretary, who was then the Environment Secretary, said quite explicitly that this
               was a commitment for the United Kingdom specifically. Can the Prime Minister clarify:
               is that the Governments view, or was his statement in Parliament the correct
               view?</seg>
            <seg>On Kosovo, the Prime Minister is absolutely right to stress the danger of this
               situation. Several countries in the area could be sucked into itSerbia, Montenegro,
               Macedonia and Bosniaand we could well be faced with flights of refugees, as we have
               had in the past. The UK may well be called upon to play a role in a peacekeeping
               capacity. The question I have for him is: what is the ability of the British
               Government to play a role in a peacekeeping capacity when British armed forces are so
               overstretched? Is not the answer to this dilemma to withdraw the remaining few
               thousand troops in Basra, who are impotent in the face of the militias running amok
               there? Finally, may I ask the Prime Minister about the commitment of Finance
               Ministers and Prime Ministers to support additional liquidity in the world economy?
               There is a simple point: if 30 billion cannot save one small regional bank in
               Britain, what is the prospect of 50 billion saving the world economy?</seg>

            <seg>I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman is making his appearance here as
               the acting leader of the Liberal party; it will elect a new leader tomorrow. I see
               that three former leaders of the Liberal party are with us today. He says that he has
               a new position on the referendumbut some members of his party want a referendum on
               the amending treaty, whereas others do not. So what has his party done? It has
               retreated to the position of 35 years ago whereby the party will have a referendum on
               whether we should be in the European Union at all. I suggest to him that that issue
               was resolved in 1975; it is in no need of being resolved again in this country.</seg>
            <seg>I turn to the hon. Gentlemans points about the specifics of the discussions. On
               Zimbabwe, it is right that we are agreed that it was wrong for Britain to be present
               at prime ministerial or Foreign Secretary level at the EU-Africa conference. However,
               if there is a change in Administration in Zimbabwe and in the respect for human
               rights, we stand ready to do what we can to help rebuild that country.</seg>
            <seg>On Kosovo, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we need a military and civilian
               presence, but I do not agree with him that Britain cannot play its part with the
               small but important numbers that we are putting in both in civilian and military
               presence.</seg>
            <seg>On the renewables issue, I think the hon. Gentleman knows what our position is: I
               made it clear in the House of Commons. The EU is committed to a 20 per cent.
               renewables target. Discussion is taking place around the EU about what individual
               contributions will be made by the member states. We await the outcome of that
               discussion, and we will then receive a target that we will implement. This is the
               right way forward, and I hope that all parties in the House of Commons will provide
               support for dealing with renewables. Finally, the hon. Gentleman mentioned the
               European financial situation in the face of global turbulence. I hope that we will
               see co-operation across Europe to deal with what have been very difficult problems
               arising from events in America, where there has already been central bank
               co-operation. We are prepared to argue for more co-operation, which is why I have
               invited Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy to London to discuss the paper that
               we have already put forward for reform of the international financial

He made reference to Kosovo.

A meeting will take place at the UNRussia will also be involved thereto see whether we can reach agreement. If we cannot do so, the EU will debate its presence in Kosovo in the next few weeks. The final decisions will be made by the Foreign Ministers. Our position is that we would then move to supervised independence of Kosovo, but we await the discussions that are taking place in the United Nations. My hon. Friend is also right to praise the Portuguese presidency: it was responsible for getting the final decisions on the amending treaty; it organised the EU-Brazil summit and the EU-Africa summit; it has moved ahead with action on Kosovo; and it put forward the declaration on globalisation, which sets a new agenda for the European Union for future years.

I agree with my hon. Friend that the environmental issues that are being addressed make the case for co-operation across the European Union. It is precisely because the EU was prepared to agree a common position that it had such influence in Bali. By working together, we can achieve more than if we work in isolation, and the Conservatives - if they seriously believe in the importance of environmental co-operation - should accept the lesson that we should co-operate across Europe in bringing forward proposals for a better environment.</seg>

               start to become sensible and engaged on Europe? I want the Conservatives to stay
               exactly where they are, because then they will never be elected to power. In his
               statement, he said, that now <quote>"we can, by working together, maximise our
                  influence".</quote> That is the European Union - utterly opposed to the
               isolationism of the Conservative party.</seg>

         <u who="#BROWN">
            <seg>My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. The Conservative party refused to answer the single most important question that it has to address: is it in favour of a referendum after ratification or not? Some 47 Conservative Members of Parliament have signed a motion calling for it. Two shadow Ministers have called for it. The shadow Foreign Secretary wants it. What is the position of the Conservative party? Unless the Conservatives can tell us, everything else is froth and has no substance at all.</seg>

            <seg>I welcome the eventual UK signature on the draft treaty, however
               clumsily we got there, but does the Prime Minister acknowledge that, as we move into
               ratification scrutiny here, it is not just going to be a matter of winning votes in
               Parliament? Those of us who support the treaty and Britains future in Europe are
               going to have to start winning the argument in the country. Towards that end, may I
               make the following plea to him, and through him, to all his Ministers? They are not
               going to persuade the British public about the long-term merits of Europe by using
               Eurosceptical language to justify the treaty they have just signed. The Prime
               Minister was at it again this afternoon, saying, <quote>"We have safeguarded this",
                  "We have defended that", and, "We have seen off the following".</quote> Why does
               he not say, <quote>"The status quo that we have today, and what we have just put our
                  names to as a country on your behalf, is an improvement?" </quote>That is what he
               believes - is it not?</seg>

         <u who="#BROWN">
            <seg>It is what I said: the co-operation across Europe on the environment, security and the economy, and what we decided at the Council, are to the benefit of not just this country but the whole world, and we should push forward with them. But it is also right for me to point out the inaccuracies in the statements that have been made from the Opposition Benches about what the amending treaty tries to achieve. As far as the charter of rights is concerned, it is not justiciable in British law. As far as foreign policy is concerned, it is still intergovernmental. As far as justice and home affairs are concerned, we have an opt-in and, in certain circumstances, an opt-out. As far as national security is concerned, it is not considered in the amending treaty. On social security, we have an emergency brake. It is right that we point out, against those who allege the opposite, what is happening. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that there should be a campaign in the country to show people the benefits of the amending treaty and membership of the European Union, and we will work together on that.</seg>

            <seg>I should remind the Opposition that, in the case of the old treaty, which was rejected, nine countries proposed to have a referendum.

            <seg>Do not the gathering storm in Kosovo and its possible implications for our stretched armed services mean that there is an even more urgent reason to re-examine not our general commitment in Afghanistan, but the particular commitment in Helmand province, which is failing to meet all its original objectives, at a grievous cost in human lives?</seg>

         <u who="#BROWN">
            <seg>I do not accept what my hon. Friend says. Last week, I made it absolutely clear that the process in which we are involved in Afghanistan is one of moving towards greater Afghan control of security by building up Afghanistans military and policing forces, and having a programme of economic, social and political development that can benefit the Afghan people. I believe that there is wide support for that among the coalition. Yes, it is true that the purpose of being in Afghanistan was to remove the Taliban and to prevent al-Qaeda from getting control. However, it is also true that now that Afghanistan is a democracy, we must bolster it and help its economic, social and political development.</seg>

I believe that there is a common view across Europe that we should support the people of Zimbabwe.
