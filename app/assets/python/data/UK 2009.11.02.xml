         <u who="#BROWN">
            <seg> First of all, I am sure the whole House will want to join me in sending our
               condolences to the family and friends of Staff Sergeant Olaf Schmid, of 11 Explosive
               Ordnance Disposal Regiment, who died in Afghanistan on Saturday afternoon. As we come
               closer to Remembrance Sunday, we recognise that we owe him and all who have given
               their lives in the service of our country, and indeed everyone who has served in our
               armed forces, an immeasurable debt of gratitude. With permission, Mr. Speaker, I
               would like to make a statement on the European Council held in Brussels last Thursday
               and Friday. The Copenhagen climate change conference, for which the European Council
               was preparing, is now less than 40 days away. If carbon emissions are to be reduced
               and dangerous climate change averted, it is essential that we achieve an ambitious,
               comprehensive and binding agreement. Concluding a climate change deal will also drive
               investment in the low-carbon economy and speed up world economic recovery. It will
               demonstrate that, as at the G20, the world can come together to address the great
               global challenges that we face together.</seg>
            <seg>In all of this, European Union leadership is fundamental, and now, as we approach
               Copenhagen, we need to drive forward the negotiations. Let me explain the urgency: to
               achieve the ambitious, effective and fair deal we need, it is not only developed
               countries which must act; developing countries too must cut their emissions, reduce
               deforestation and be able to adapt to climate change. However, to enable them to make
               an offer by December, we as a European Union and as developed countries need to make
               a credible offer of financial assistance to them now. That is why earlier this year I
               proposed a long-term financial agreement between developed and developing countries.
               On Friday last week the European Council agreed to put on the table for Copenhagen
               three conditional offers. First, we agreed that Europe will contribute its fair share
               of the costs of mitigation and adaptation in developing countries, and we endorsed
               the European Commission view that these are expected to require-including the
               developing countries' own contributions-around 100 billion of private and public
               finance annually by 2020.</seg>
            <seg>Secondly, we set out our offer of public finance, agreeing that the overall level
               of the international public support required to make sure that a Copenhagen deal
               would benefit developing countries is estimated to lie in the range of 22 billion to
               50 billion per year by 2020. </seg>
            <seg>Thirdly, we agreed that we should start support immediately to help developing
               countries cut carbon emissions and adapt to climate change, contributing over the
               next three years, as a European Union, our fair share of a global fast-track
               initiative of 5 billion to 7 billion per year. These offers are rightly conditional
               on <quote>"other key players making comparable efforts"</quote>, and on developing
               countries coming forward with substantial commitments on emissions reductions.
               Importantly, the Council also agreed that climate financing should <quote>"not
                  undermine or jeopardize the fight against poverty and continued progress towards
                  the Millennium Development Goals"</quote>, and as the United Kingdom has proposed,
               the Council supported the establishment of a high-level body under the United Nations
               to provide an overview of international sources of climate financing.</seg>
            <seg>The European Union has already committed to cut our emissions by 30 per cent. on
               1990 levels by 2020 as part of the right international agreement. Now these financial
               offers yet again show the determination of the whole European Union to ensure an
               ambitious climate change deal in Copenhagen. I can also report that the Council
               agreed that at the time of the next accession treaty, the protocol on the charter of
               fundamental rights will be applied to the Czech Republic. The next step is for the
               Czech constitutional court to make its ruling, which is rightly a matter for that
               court. I believe that we have made real progress, but it is only after we are sure
               that the treaty will come into force that a new European Commission will be appointed
               and the Council will be able to appoint its new president. Investment across Europe
               is forecast to contract by 10 per cent. this year with an expected loss of 8.5
               million jobs. So at the European Council we had to decide first whether we should
               withdraw the fiscal stimulus now or maintain it until recovery was secured. We agreed
               unanimously-with no country dissenting-that <quote>"the supporting policies should
                  not be withdrawn until the recovery is fully secured."</quote> Secondly, we had to
               decide whether to support public investment to maintain jobs in our economy or simply
               to let the recession take its course. The Council agreed unanimously to draw up a
                  <quote>"European strategy for jobs and growth"</quote> with <quote>"continued
                  political commitment to active labour market policies".</quote> We also agreed to
               take all necessary measures to <quote>"prevent high unemployment levels from becoming
                  persistent."</quote> Thirdly, within our commitment to action for fiscal
               sustainability once the recovery is assured, we also agreed on the need for active
               industrial strategies to ensure <quote>"investment in the industries and jobs of the
                  future"</quote>, including low-carbon technologies, advanced manufacturing and the
               digital economy. We stressed the importance of new measures that would
                  <quote>"strengthen the internal market"</quote> and help growth in our services as
               well as our industries, and we affirmed the need to <quote>"promote increased
                  trade".</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>In addition to the completion of the Doha trade round next year, progress on
               bilateral trade deals and the recent trade agreement with Korea will create up to 20
               billion in new export opportunities for firms across the European Union. We also
               agreed on reform of our banking systems, which includes putting in place new rules on
               capital and liquidity and bonuses. We also agreed to the continuation of work to
               strengthen the supervisory framework in the European Union, following the decisions
               taken at the Council in June.</seg>
            <seg>The Council also expressed its deep condolences to the families of those killed in
               last week's Taliban attack in Kabul. We reaffirmed our determination to fight
               terrorism in every part of the world and our resolve to see our commitments through
               in Afghanistan. And we emphasised our <quote>"confidence in the United Nations'
                  leadership in coordinating the international community's efforts".</quote> We
               welcomed plans to <quote>"strengthen the civilian capacity of the state institutions
                  in Afghanistan and Pakistan"</quote>- something that has been at the heart of
               British efforts in recent years. And the European Council expressed its concern about
               the security situation in Pakistan and reiterated Europe's readiness to assist
               further the displaced members of the Pakistan population. This afternoon, I have
               spoken to President Karzai and discussed the importance of moving quickly to set out
               a unity programme for the future governance of Afghanistan. Afghanistan now needs new
               and urgent measures for tackling corruption, strengthening local government and
               reaching out to all parts of Afghan society, and to give the Afghan people a real
               stake in their future. President Karzai agreed with me that Afghanistan now needs to
               strengthen its army and police numbers so that over time we can reduce the number of
               British troops.</seg>
            <seg>Finally on Iran, the Council expressed its <quote>"continuing concern about the
                  situation of staff members of European Union missions and European citizens in
                  Iran who recently have been on trial"</quote> and called, in support of our
               efforts, for <quote>"their prompt and unconditional release".</quote> We reaffirmed
               our <quote>"grave concern over the development of Iran's nuclear programme"</quote>
               and over Iran's <quote>"persistent failure to meet its international
                  obligations."</quote> Once again, we have shown that by acting not alone but
               together, by working not against our mainstream European partners, but with them, and
               by putting Britain not on the fringes of Europe, but at the heart of Europe, Britain
               will be stronger, and Europe and Britain will be better off for that.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>May I join the Prime Minister in paying tribute to Staff Sergeant Olaf Schmid,
               killed in Afghanistan at the weekend? We owe a debt of gratitude to him and his
               family that we must never forget. In Afghanistan, now that Hamid Karzai has been
               confirmed as President, will the Prime Minister ensure that our support for the
               Karzai Government is not a blank cheque, but is contingent on serious progress being
               made on tackling corruption and upholding the rule of law? I want to ask the Prime
               Minister about the three main issues that were raised at the summit, climate change,
               the economy and the Lisbon treaty, and of course the two words that did not pass his
               lips-Tony Blair - because I cannot believe that the Prime Minister did not mention
               the one issue that seemed to be discussed wherever the leaders met: who should be the
               president of Europe. When considering his efforts to get Tony Blair the job, will
               most people in Britain not feel that it is completely unacceptable to see an
               unelected Prime Minister pushing for an unelected president, under a treaty that no
               one was allowed to vote for?</seg>
            <seg>Climate change is an area where the EU has a vital role to play. Will the Prime
               Minister confirm that it already has the powers that it needs to do so? There is
               nothing in the Lisbon treaty that adds anything to the EU's ability in this area. We
               welcome the commitments on carbon reductions, which were repeated at the summit, and
               the agreement on the 100 billion climate change fund. However, is it not the case
               that, despite that headline figure, there was no agreement on which European
               countries should pay what or by when, and that there was no firm commitment on the
               financial help to be given in the vital first three years after an agreement at
               Copenhagen is signed? The Swedish Prime Minister seemed to say that the European
               contributions would only be voluntary. Can the Prime Minister explain what that
               meant?</seg>
            <seg>Next, on the economy, the Prime Minister said at his press conference that there
               was a target of 10 million new jobs in Europe by 2014. Yet is it not the case that
               unemployment in the UK is now higher than it was in 1997, that 5 million people are
               on out-of-work benefits and that we have practically the highest youth unemployment
               in Europe? When he looked across the table at other EU leaders, did he recall that
               Belgium, the Czech Republic, Greece, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, France and Germany
               have already come out of recession, while Britain is still stuck in recession? Last
               Wednesday the Prime Minister said in this House: <quote>"We always said that we would
                  come out of recession by the end of this year."</quote>
               <note>Official Report, 28 October 2009; Vol. 498, c. 278.</note>
            </seg>
            <seg>That simply is not right. The forecast last autumn was for recovery in July. This
               June he said that Britain was <quote>"leading the rest of the world...out of
                  recession."</quote>
               <note>Official Report, 3 June 2009; Vol. 493, c. 268.</note>
            </seg>
            <seg>Will he now confirm that he got it completely wrong? While we are still in
               recession and other countries in the EU grow, will he also confirm that we are
               forecast to have practically the highest budget deficit in the whole of Europe next
               year? The summit conclusions endorse the ECOFIN statement that some countries should
               start to rebuild their public finances before 2011. As we are forecast to have the
               largest deficit in the whole of the OECD next year, should that not include us? Is it
               not the height of irresponsibility to sit there, as the leader of a lame duck
               Government with deteriorating public finances, making pledge after pledge of further
               public spending and never saying anything about how he would deal with the crisis
               that he has created? The third issue is Lisbon and whether Europe needs a president.
               Does this debate not tell people all that they need to know about this Government? On
               the one hand, the Government went round saying that the treaty was just a tidying-up
               exercise, that there was no threat to national sovereignty and that the
               constitutional principle had been abandoned. But on the other, now we see the Prime
               Minister using all his offices to try to foist on Europe an executive president, with
               every intention of maximising the power of this new office. Is it not the case that
               the Government have not been straight on the treaty from start to finish?</seg>
            <seg>The only silver lining is that the bid to make Tony Blair president seems to have
               got into a bit of difficulty. Just a few days ago it was all going so well</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BRYANT">
            <seg>Who's your candidate?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>Who is my candidate? Perhaps the hon. Gentleman-never someone to go naked into the
               conference chamber. It was all going so well. As the Prime Minister left for
               Brussels, one British official was quoted as saying: <quote>"Tony Blair is the ideal
                  candidate and he has a lot of support from all quarters...It is hard to see how he
                  can be stopped."</quote> Shortly afterwards, the Prime Minister gave Tony Blair
               his personal backing. He threw the weight of the Government spin machine behind the
               Blair campaign. He broke into his schedule to appear before the Party of European
               Socialists. He told them all to <quote>"get real"</quote> and back Tony Blair. Ever
               since then, Tony Blair's campaign has been in free fall. Does that not demonstrate an
               eternal truth in British politics: that no cause is truly hopeless until it is
               endorsed by this Prime Minister?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BROWN">
            <seg>Once again, not one policy from the Opposition-it is all about personalities, never
               anything about policy. Let us first turn to Afghanistan. I did say earlier that I had
               talked to President Karzai and I did say to him that it was absolutely essential that
               he brought forward a unity programme that would include tackling corruption,
               strengthening the anti-corruption commission and taking action in individual areas,
               as well as bringing forward measures to strengthen local government. Of course, it is
               also important to us to build up the army from 90,000 now to 135,000 and to build up
               the police force, which is under 100,000 at the moment but is not sufficiently
               effective. So we have made the offer of further troops in Afghanistan conditional on
               Afghanistan showing that it can deal with its problems by making available new forces
               to be trained. At the same time, we await the decisions that will be made in other
               capitals about their contribution to the next stage of Afghanisation, which is
               increasing the number of Afghan troops but allowing them to be trained by forces from
               Britain and other countries.</seg>
            <seg>I am also grateful for what the right hon. Gentleman said about climate change. It
               is absolutely essential that we come together to make sure that we have a deal at
               Copenhagen, but European leadership and European unity in this are absolutely
               crucial. The right hon. Gentleman asked whether the 2020 deal was a voluntary one.
               No, it is not. What is voluntary is the fast-track offer, which is the offer for the
               first three years according to which different European countries will choose to make
               their own contributions. But, again, a deal at Copenhagen is possible on finance only
               because Europe, as a European Union, has led the way in making that finance
               available.</seg>
            <seg>When it comes to the economy, I just have to say that the Government support fiscal
               action continuing. The right hon. Gentleman's party wants to withdraw the fiscal
               stimulus; I found no support in any country in Europe for withdrawing the fiscal
               stimulus now. His party has refused to back direct action using Government funds
               against unemployment; I found no party in Europe supporting that action either. His
               party, of course, has rejected many of the proposals that we have brought forward to
               deal with the recession; I find support for what we are doing in Europe, not support
               for the Conservative position. The right hon. Gentleman also mentioned the Lisbon
               treaty and its ratification. We know the position of the Conservative party. Its
               leader said: <quote>"I will give this cast-iron guarantee: If I become PM a
                  Conservative government will hold a referendum on any EU treaty that emerges from
                  these negotiations."</quote> That is the position of the Conservative party</seg>

         <u who="#BROWN">
            <seg>Whenever the word "Europe" is mentioned, the Opposition seem to become both extreme
               and wild in the actions that they take. The right hon. Gentleman is demanding a
               referendum on Lisbon. He is also-I see Back Benchers nodding, but not the Leader of
               the Opposition-demanding withdrawal from the social chapter and from European Union
               employment legislation, for which he would need the agreement of every one of the 26
               other countries in the European Union. When the challenge is actually to secure
               growth, a climate change agreement and greater security from the European Union, is
               it going to be the best use of British influence to fight yesterday's battles the
               minute that the European Union has moved on from them when there is so much that we
               have to do to promote jobs, growth and trade? Is it really in the British national
               interest for the Conservative party to leave aside the alliances that it has had for
               years with the Christian Democrats in Germany and with President Sarkozy's party in
               France and to go into an alliance with a small group on the far right of Europe? The
               only reason the Conservatives are doing that is not in the national interest; they
               are putting their own party interests first and letting Euroscepticism take over
               their party. If they had really changed, they would have changed on Europe, and just
               as they are wrong on the recession, they are wrong on Europe as well.</seg>

         <u who="#CLEGG">
            <seg>I should like to thank the Prime Minister for his statement and, of course, join
               him in sending expressions of sympathy and condolence to the family and friends of
               Staff Sergeant Olaf Schmid, who tragically lost his life in Afghanistan this week. On
               Afghanistan, I note that the Prime Minister has already called President Karzai to
               congratulate him today on his unopposed continuation as president of that country,
               but surely the Prime Minister must recognise that Karzai simply cannot lead the
               dramatic change in direction that Afghanistan needs unless he commits now to work
               with his opponents, including Dr. Abdullah, to reach across ethnic and tribal
               divisions, stamp out corruption and start to build the legitimate institutions of
               central Government that Afghanistan so desperately lacks. The only way to do that is
               to commit now to a Government of national unity, and not the vaguer "unity programme"
               to which the Prime Minister just referred. What pressure are the Government bringing
               to bear on the Karzai Administration to make that happen? Or is the Prime Minister
               going to ignore the lack of legitimacy of the Karzai presidency and so risk failure
               for our brave troops as they try to prop up a Government in whom no one
               believes?</seg>
            <seg>Turning to the rest of the weekend's summit, the event was remarkable for two
               reasons: first, the discussion of the historic negotiations to be held in Copenhagen;
               secondly, the Government's misguided attempt to install Tony Blair as president of
               Europe. On Copenhagen, I welcome in principle the agreement on a funding package to
               help developing countries to fight climate change, but does the Prime Minister not
               see that the European Union's leadership in this area is in jeopardy while he and
               other leaders remain silent on how the cost of those proposals for adaptation and
               mitigation will be met in practice? What consideration has he given, for instance, to
               funding these commitments, in whole or in part, through a tradeable levy on maritime
               and aviation fuels? Is it not time we asked the aviation and shipping industries,
               which currently remain outside any international carbon fuel levy system, to pay for
               the damage that they cause to our environment by asking them to help to fund the
               fight against climate change in the developing world?</seg>
            <seg>On the second issue, I congratulate the Prime Minister on what turns out to have
               been a very cunning plan indeed to block the career aspirations of his predecessor.
               Does he agree, however, that the outcome of the discussions on Tony Blair has been to
               strengthen Britain's hand in arguing for the position that we should have been
               lobbying for in the first place - that of the High Representative? The president will
               be a glorified chairman, without his own resources, like an admiral without a navy,
               but the High Representative will have real powers-a general with troops, by
               comparison. So will the Prime Minister confirm that that is the job that we are now
               aiming for? Will he also give us an indication of who he would like to see in the
               role? We all know that he is pushing the right hon. Member for South Shields
                  <note>David Miliband</note>, but will he also look beyond his party ranks for
               other candidates <incident>
                  <desc>Hon. Members: "Hurrah!"</desc>
               </incident> No, no, no - that is for another day. I meant other candidates such as
               Lord Patten, who I am sure would be welcome on these Benches, or indeed Lord
               Ashdown.</seg>
            <seg>The Prime Minister referred to the summit's deliberations on banking. When I asked
               him a couple of weeks ago, he refused even to contemplate splitting up the banks, yet
               it is now clear that the European Commission is driving forward a process to break
               them up. Will he explain why, if he is willing to hive off huge divisions of the
               banks at the behest of Europe, he will not go the whole way and separate retail and
               investment banking completely? Why will he not split up the banks in the only way
               that would protect the public interest for good?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BROWN">
            <seg>I do not think that there has ever been a more public application for a European
               job than what we have heard this afternoon. I could see the sense of opportunity in
               the eyes of the right hon. Gentleman's colleagues as they thought about his future
               prospects. On climate change, we have done more than any continent in the world to
               put forward proposals to sort out a major problem that has to be addressed - the
               financing gap. If developing countries are to be persuaded to make their use of
               energy more efficient, and if they are to be given help to deal with adaptation, it
               is essential that we put an offer on the table. So Europe has done three things: it
               has put an offer on the table relating to the overall funding required; it has now
               said what the public amount of that money would be; and it has said that it will be
               engaged in giving fast-track financing. So the process would start even before the
               new treaty would come in. We have also made it clear that Europe would pay its fair
               share of that money. We are therefore further on in pushing this forward than any
               other continent. We need other continents to respond to this but, most of all, we put
               this offer last week because we want the developing countries to consider what offers
               they can make to reduce their carbon emissions by the time they get to Copenhagen.
               Europe has taken the lead on this matter, and while the right hon. Gentleman wishes
               us to do more, he would be right if he said that Europe had taken the first steps
               towards the necessary financial agreement.</seg>
            <seg>On Afghanistan, I made it clear while talking to President Karzai twice this
               weekend that we are expecting him to take strong action on tackling corruption in his
               own country. This is what Afghanistan is about: it is not simply a country that
               requires national Government; it requires good effective local government and good
               provincial and district governors, and we expect the appointments of those people to
               be in line with the needs of the country. That includes tackling corruption and
               getting the economy and social facilities moving. For us, it is also crucial that the
               Afghan Government agree to train more troops and more police. The way that we will be
               able to deliver greater security to the Afghan people, to prevent a Taliban
               Government from returning to power and to prevent al-Qaeda from having a greater
               foothold in the country is by building up the strength of the Afghan forces.</seg>
            <seg>I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that these messages to
               President Karzai are very clear. He will, of course, make a speech tomorrow and then
               there will be his inauguration address. I hope that what we have asked him to do and
               what he has agreed to do - it is also what he wants to do-will be included in that
               address. As far as the European Council is concerned, let me be absolutely clear. The
               Lisbon treaty is not yet ratified. When it is ratified there will have to be a
               meeting of the European Council, and only at that stage will decisions be made about
               either the presidency of the Council or the future of the Commission. Unlike some
               Conservative Members, I hope that the Czech Government will be able to ratify the
               treaty very soon. I hope that we can see a decision from the Czech constitutional
               court tomorrow, and were that to be the case, I would expect ratification to proceed
               very soon afterwards. We will then be able to make decisions on these important
               positions in the European Union as soon as possible. It is not in anybody's interest
               to have no Commission re-nominated for the future; we will be electing a president of
               the Council for the first time.</seg>

               practise corrupt activities from either seizing power or influencing those who have
               power. Therefore, part of the programme for Afghanistan must be to match

               help to finance carbon capture and storage. It is important that we have some of the
               demonstration plants, and we are trying hard to ensure that Britain has a number of
               them for future years. He is also right to suggest that we should consider how we can

               enough of them. We wish the Afghan forces, Afghan police and Afghan security
               personnel to be able to take responsibility for the management of law and order in
               the provinces and then throughout Afghanistan. That is what we are trying achieve,
               and in order to do so we will need to help train Afghan forces. So far as the rest of
               the question is concerned, we know there are problems of corruption in Afghanistan
               and we know they have got to be dealt with. The key step is to persuade the
               Government of Afghanistan that they must take these problems even more
               seriously.</seg>

            <seg>The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The only difficulty his party faces is
               that, because there are 27 countries in the European Union, we have had to have a new
               treaty so we can deal with the institutional mechanisms necessary for the governance
               of the EU. I therefore hope that at the same time as supporting enlargement, the hon.

            <seg>Before the original election in Afghanistan, I and others were party to persuading

               number of cases within the European Union. The issue now, which was raised by the
               McChrystal report, is what numbers different countries will be prepared to offer
               following the elections. That is a matter for discussion at NATO in the next few
               days. I believe not only that we will have proposals arising from McChrystal very
               soon, but that we have already taken the right decision, which is that we are
               prepared to put additional forces in, subject to the conditions that I laid down in
               Parliament: that Afghan forces are available to be trained, and that we have an

               referendum on this treaty. The Leader of the Opposition gave a "cast-iron guarantee"
               that he would have a referendum. We must also be clear that the Opposition have voted
               that they wish to withdraw from the social chapter and European employment
               legislation, but for that they would need the support of 26 other members of the

               mistake if they want to send out a message to the rest of Europe that they do not
               want a British person to hold this job. Presumably they want someone from another
               country to hold this job-presumably someone who also holds a federalist position in
