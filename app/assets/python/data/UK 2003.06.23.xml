         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>With permission, Mr Speaker. I shall make a statement on the European Council,
               which I attended in Greece on 19 and 20 June. I should like to offer my thanks to
               Prime Minister Simitis and the Greek Government, who have conducted an effective
               presidency in a particularly difficult period.</seg>
            <seg>The European Council took delivery of the draft constitutional treaty prepared by
               the European Convention under the expert chairmanship of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. We
               agreed that the draft is a good basis for starting the intergovernmental conference
               in October. The 10 countries joining the European Council will participate fully
               alongside the existing member Governments. The aim is to conclude it in time for a
               new treaty to be signed after 1 May next year.</seg>
            <seg>The Convention sets out clearly what Europe is for, its aims and objectives, the
               rights of its citizens, the powers and responsibilities of its institutions and the
               way it takes forward its policies. It recognises expressly that what we want is a
               Europe of nations, not a federal superstate, and that issues to do with taxation,
               foreign policy, defence policy and our own British borders will remain the
               prerogative of our national Government and Parliament.</seg>
            <seg>The draft makes clear in the very first article that the Union only has those
               powers that member states give it. It introduces a Chair of the European Council to
               prepare and follow through the European Council agenda. It will bring an end to the
               present system of six-monthly presidencies, which is no longer feasible in a Union of
               25. It will provide a greater role for national Parliaments, which will be able to
               vet all new legislation and make the principle of subsidiarity work at the political
               level.</seg>
            <seg>There are of course areas where there is continuing negotiation—for example, over
               enhanced co-operation, the structure of the presidency and the role of qualified
               majority voting—but above all the new draft treaty offers the prospect of stability
               in the way in which Europe works.</seg>
            <seg>I should like to pay tribute to the work done by Ministers and to other hon.
               Members, for the contribution that they made to the work of the Convention. In
               addition to the Convention outcome, reflecting the work of its 200 members, Mr
               Giscard d'Estaing also referred to a minority report put forward in the Convention,
               including by the right hon. Member for Wells <note>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</note>, the
               representative of the Conservative party. That report would turn the existing
               treaties into an association of states that would replace, and dismantle, the
               existing European Union.</seg>
            <seg>The European Council agreed a range of actions to secure our frontiers, to ensure
               better co-operation with third countries on migration issues and to enable us to take
               the action we need to deal more effectively with asylum claims. Among the issues that
               we discussed was one on which we have been working closely with the European
               Commission and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The aim is to
               strengthen the protection of refugees in their regions of origin so that, in a
               crisis, it is possible to offer effective and accessible sanctuary to refugees closer
               to their homes. To test whether such a scheme can work, we—with the support of the
               Commission—proposed pilot projects, which had widespread support. While the unanimity
               requirement in the Council prevented the idea from being specifically endorsed, that
               will not prevent the pilot projects from being taken forward by a number of member
               states and the Commission will report back on them within the year.</seg>
            <seg>The Council discussed a paper by the EU High Representative, Javier Solana, for an
               overall strategy in the field of foreign and security policy. He proposed a
               comprehensive approach to dealing with the global problems of poverty, terrorism, and
               weapons of mass destruction, stressing the importance of the relationship with the
               United States, the need to improve our military capability and the necessity, in the
               last resort, for pre-emptive military action. The Council endorsed a comprehensive
               plan for tackling the spread of weapons of mass destruction. This will be a
               particular theme of this week's EU-US summit as we take forward our joint work on
               curbing the export of WMD. The summit will also focus on the trade and economic
               agenda, especially the need for a successful meeting of the World Trade Organisation
               in Cancun, and foreign policy co-operation, notably in the middle east.</seg>
            <seg>President Chirac and I had proposed, following the G8 summit, that the EU should
               match the US by contributing up to Euro1 billion in 2004 to the global health fund to
               combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Although this had majority support, some
               member states objected and, because of the unanimity requirement, we could not secure
               agreement at the Council to that sum, but we did agree that the Union would determine
               the extent of its contribution at the pledging conference on 16 July.</seg>
            <seg>There was a strong focus at the meeting on the EU's relations with the wider world.
               Putting our support behind the middle east peace process, we called on Hamas and
               other groups to declare a ceasefire and endorsed an urgent examination of the case
               for wider action against Hamas fundraising. We expressed serious concern at aspects
               of the Iranian nuclear programme and our full support for the International Atomic
               Energy Agency in its effort to conduct a comprehensive examination of Iran's nuclear
               programme. We made it clear that the way in which Iran behaves on human rights,
               terrorism and the middle east peace process is crucial to the future development of
               EU-Iran relations.</seg>
            <seg>Finally, we held a positive discussion about Iraq. The European Council affirmed
               the European Union's readiness to take part in the reconstruction of Iraq within the
               framework of UN Security Council resolution 1483. We commissioned further work on the
               details of the help that the EU can provide.</seg>
            <seg>The Council took stock of the economic situation following the spring summit on
               economic reform. It set a clear agenda for action in line with the objectives, which
               Britain and a number of other member states have been advocating. The Council also
               endorsed the appointment of Jean-Claude Trichet as the next President of the European
               Central Bank, in accordance with the agreement reached during the last UK
               presidency.</seg>
            <seg>What is clear is that Europe at 25 nations will be very different from Europe at
               15. In the coming years, Europe will expand still further to welcome Romania,
               Bulgaria, Turkey and possibly others. Plainly, this means that Europe must change the
               way it works. There are several areas in which the Convention proposes moving to
               qualified majority voting, including on trade in services and in the fight against
               terrorism, drugs and illegal immigration. We should not, however, fear every
               extension of qualified majority voting as hostile to Britain. In some areas, we need
               QMV. The only reason we have any hope of achieving reform in, for example, the common
               agricultural policy is that decisions in the Agriculture Council are determined by
               QMV. It was thanks to QMV that we opened up energy markets. If we want to drive
               through economic reform, liberalise markets, and break down state subsidies, then, in
               a Europe of 25, QMV on such issues as trade in services and mutual recognition of
               qualifications is essential for the British national interest. Britain needs Europe
               to work and, for Europe to work, it needs to change.</seg>
            <seg>That is not all that will be different in a Europe of 25 or 30. The new nations
               joining the EU share, in many ways, the British perspective. They are firmly in
               favour of the transatlantic alliance. Freed from communism, they do not fear economic
               reform; they welcome it. Freed from subjugation by the former Soviet Union, the
               central and east Europeans have no intention or desire to yield up the nationhood for
               which they have fought so hard. It is no surprise, therefore, that the Convention so
               explicitly ruled out a European federal superstate.</seg>
            <seg>It is not only the new members that will sign up to that vision of Europe.
               Increasingly, Europe knows that the focus for its economy and for its security has to
               be outward, not inward. The danger for Britain is that, at the very time when Europe
               is moving closer to the view of Europe with which we are most comfortable, and which
               we can advocate so well, we should lose the chance to take our proper place in Europe
               by fighting battles long since over, and by turning away at the very point when
               Europe is turning towards us.</seg>
            <seg>There are real battles, of course —for example, over tax or defence— but they are
               battles that we can win. At this point in time, with Europe at a crucial point of
               evolution, this nation, Britain, has to have the confidence to stride forward in
               Europe, not hang back. The next year will determine the shape of Europe of which we
               are a member. There will be critical alliances to be made and choices to be faced,
               but I have no doubt that a Europe that now stretches from Finland and the Baltic
               states to the shores of the Aegean sea, Cyprus and Malta is a Europe that should
               have, and will have, Britain at its heart.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#SMITH">
            <seg>I thank the Prime Minister for his statement and congratulate the Greek Government
               on their hard work. I welcome the recent signing of the accession treaty in Athens. I
               also welcome the statement of support for the middle east road map for peace.</seg>
            <seg>There were, however, three failures arising from Thessaloniki. First, yet another
               European summit has passed with no commitment to, or even discussion of, real reform
               of the common agricultural policy, despite the Prime Minister's QMV. Secondly, the
               Prime Minister failed to obtain EU backing for his offshore asylum centres; his pilot
               projects will not hide his failure. Thirdly, we got the European constitution.</seg>
            <seg>The Government have claimed that the proposed European constitution is just
                  <quote>"a tidying-up exercise"</quote>; yet is it not the case that the
               constitution will set up a European president, transfer asylum and immigration policy
               to Brussels, establish a binding charter of fundamental rights and create an
               overarching constitutional settlement in which the EU can expand its powers without
               the approval of national Parliaments? The Government have completely understated the
               all-embracing nature of that constitution.</seg>
            <seg>Recently, the German Foreign Minister said that the constitution is <quote>"the
                  most important treaty since the formation of the European Economic
                  Community"</quote>. At the same time, our Prime Minister says that the
               constitution <quote>"does not involve a fundamental change to the British
                  constitution"</quote>.</seg>
            <seg>
               <bibl type="source">Official Report, 18 June 2003; Vol. 407, c. 352.</bibl>
            </seg>
            <seg>What nonsense! The constitution will fundamentally change the way in which every
               country in Europe is governed. Everybody else sees that. The Prime Minister always
               talks about his red lines in the debate on the constitution, so will he tell us why
               they keep moving? Will he tell us why he opposed a binding charter of fundamental
               rights, but now accepts it; why he opposed an EU Foreign Minister, but now supports
               one; why he wanted to limit QMV, but now, apparently, wants even more of it; and why
               he rejected the need for a written EU constitution, but now embraces it?</seg>
            <seg>The Laeken declaration rightly stated that <quote>"the European institutions must
                  be brought closer to its citizens"</quote>. Is it not the case, however, that the
               constitution is top down and even more centralising? The Prime Minister wants to hide
               his Government's failure by setting up a false debate about staying in the EU or
               leaving it. The real debate is not about staying or leaving. The Conservative party
               does not want Britain to leave the EU; we want to make it work. I remind the Prime
               Minister that he is the one who wants to make Europe a superpower — that is his
               policy. That is the real debate and he will do absolutely anything to avoid it.</seg>
            <seg>The President of the Convention, whom the Prime Minister was lauding during his
               statement, said that <quote>"constitutions are created by citizens and adopted by
                  them in referendums"</quote>. A growing number of European countries are
               committing to a referendum on the matter, and 88 per cent. of the British people say
               that they want a referendum. So, if the Prime Minister believes that he is doing the
               right thing, why does he not hold a referendum and let the British people
               decide?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>First, let us deal with the common agricultural policy. The right hon. Gentleman
               says that it was a great failure that the policy was not dealt with at the
               Council</seg>
            <incident>
               <desc>Interruption.</desc>
            </incident>
            <seg>Let me deal with the CAP first. The reason why we did not deal with the CAP at the
               European Council is simple: it would have been quite disastrous to have transferred
               discussion of the CAP from the Agriculture Council, where there is QMV, to the
               European Council, where there is unanimity. For that very reason, everyone who was in
               favour of common agricultural reform asked us not to take it at the European Council,
               but to leave it at the Agriculture Council.</seg>
            <seg>The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that other member states objected to the
               pilot projects and that, because of the unanimity requirement, we cannot get them
               through on the basis that we originally anticipated. However, because the United
               Nations High Commissioner for Refugees supports the projects, we are able to
               undertake them and the Council agreed that the European Commission should report back
               on those issues.</seg>
            <seg>The full-time president of the Council, whom the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, is
               good for this country because it allows us to make sure that we have the Council with
               an agenda that is driven through, rather than 25 nation states having a rotating
               six-monthly presidency.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#SMITH">
            <seg>You were against it.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>I am sorry; it was our proposal. Our proposal is to replace the rotating
               six-monthly president with a full-time chairman; otherwise, we will not be able to
               get a consistent agenda, driven by the Council—the intergovernmental body that covers
               all the work of Europe.</seg>
            <seg>The right hon. Gentleman mentioned QMV, on which our position is that if it is in
               our interests, we accept it; if it is not, we do not. It is quite wrong to say that
               every extension of QMV is always hostile to Britain. May I simply remind him that,
               under the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty, there were massive
               extensions of qualified majority voting, for entirely sensible reasons to do with the
               British national interest? Indeed, most of those on his Front Bench, though not him,
               voted in favour of those extensions. The right hon. Gentleman is right to say,
               however, that the divide between the parties is very clear. The right hon. Member for
               Wells <note>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</note> has published his alternative convention
               document, which the Conservatives say is very good and effective.</seg>

            <seg>Thank you. That is now the Conservatives' policy, but let me tell them what it
               says. Let us look at the document that is now being endorsed by those on the
               Conservative Front Bench. It says: <quote>"We propose to transform the EU into a
                  Europe of Democracies... which shall be a treaty association of free and

            <seg>Fine: they are all in agreement with that. It goes on to say: <quote>"A national
                  parliament shall have a veto on an issue it deems important."</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>So that is an end to any concept of any issue being driven through by Europe in
               that way. The right hon. Member for Wells may be right, he may be wrong—many Members
               are nodding and saying that he is right—but let us be quite clear that that is
               effectively redrawing Britain's membership of the European Union.</seg>
            <seg>If Conservative Front Benchers endorse that policy document, their policy is wholly

            <seg>Yes, it is, and it would mean that we would have to redraw and renegotiate
               Britain's membership of the EU. That is now the position of the right hon. Member for
               Chingford and Wood Green <note>Mr. Duncan Smith</note>, and it is fundamentally

               British membership of the EU. That is what it is, and it would mean renegotiating our

            <seg>My right hon. and hon. Friends and I certainly welcome the acceptance of the

               that many years ago, it would have been unthinkable that 15 existing member states
               and 10 accession countries could reach even this degree of consensus for sensible
               co-operation over the development of the EU.</seg>
            <seg>There will be an intergovernmental conference later in the year, albeit that we do
               not know how long it will last, and I gather that the Government now acknowledge that

               proposals.</seg>
            <seg>We obviously welcome that, but do the Government acknowledge that it would assist
               the House's capacity to discuss these matters in even more detail if they were to
               publish a White Paper outlining with more specific intent their approach to the
               forthcoming negotiations and their position on the relevant articles?</seg>
            <seg>It was good to hear the Prime Minister make the positive case, where appropriate,
               for the relevant extensions to qualified majority voting and for the relevant
               applications of that process, and to begin to destroy some of the myths attached to
               that by opponents of the process. The Government have described the proposals as they
               stand as a "good basis" for discussion. Surely, a dividing line must be drawn between
               what is a good basis for the ensuing discussion and allowing the unravelling of the
               basis of the Convention proposals, which is what some of the wreckers want to happen.
               Does the Prime Minister acknowledge the inherent dangers in that?</seg>
            <seg>The Prime Minister mentioned the minority report that was issued by the right hon.
               Member for Wells <note>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</note> and six other members of the
               Convention. In an article in last week's The Wall Street Journal, the right hon.
               Gentleman referred to foreign and security policy and mutual solidarity, as it is
               described. That goes to the central issue, which the Prime Minister may want to
               address. The right hon. Member for Wells argued: <quote>"Since this solidarity
                  requirement will be enshrined in a constitution, it will be legally
                  binding."</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>Does the Prime Minister agree that it is incumbent on him, the Foreign Secretary
               and all those involved to make the case for a strengthened conduct of EU external
               relations based on the institutions of the Union, which remain emphatically
               intergovernmental under these processes? Does he also agree that that will provide
               sufficient safeguards for independent foreign policy making by member states,
               including any British Government coming before the House of Commons?</seg>
            <seg>In that respect, the proposed Foreign Minister role is to be welcomed, as is the
               solidarity shown over Iran and the middle east peace process. Does the Prime Minister
               agree that if that solidarity could be extended to Iraq it would assist the cause
               against weapons of mass destruction?</seg>
            <seg>The proposed intergovernmental agency for defence issues, not least research and
               procurement, is to be welcomed. Many a Committee of the House has examined this area,
               and we all know about the excessive wastage on procurement measures over the years.
               Equally welcome is the fact that taxation policy is to remain within the ambit of
               nation states, Governments and Parliaments.</seg>
            <seg>On asylum, immigration and cross-border crime, not much progress seems to have been
               made on the first two. The Prime Minister said that the European Commission will
               report back on the pilot projects that did not command unanimity. What is the time
               scale for that report back, and what force will it have? The whole point of a
               constitution for Europe is to codify the relevant levels of responsibility and
               competence. That should satisfy Euro-supporters and Eurosceptics alike. In the House
               and in the debate in Britain, we must identify and make clear the difference between
               reassuring those who are constructively sceptical about aspects of Europe and those
               diehards who can never be satisfied. The leader of the Conservative party talks about
               a false debate. Is it not important that for the first time we have a voluntary exit
               clause for EU member states, which will place an obligation on each and every
               political party in British politics to make it clear whether it would ever wish to
               avail itself of such a clause?</seg>
            <seg>In so far as the Convention moves us forward towards a Europe that is more
               democratic, more accountable and more transparent, it is to be welcomed. As a
               country, only inside Europe can we continue to make that case constructively—not
               increasingly destructively outside it.</seg>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>First, in relation to how we proceed from now, the issue of a White Paper is being
               discussed by the usual channels, and that is one possible alternative.</seg>
            <seg>It is important to emphasise that, in a Europe of 25, it must be in our
               interests—except in vital sets of circumstances such as foreign policy, defence or
               tax—to extend QMV, without which we cannot make Europe work effectively. I agree with
               the right hon. Gentleman entirely about that, although it is important that we do not
               unravel what was seen—not always here, but certainly abroad—as essentially a good
               deal for Britain.</seg>
            <seg>It is important to retain unanimity on the common foreign and security policy. We
               want Europe to develop a better and more effective common foreign and security
               policy, which is why, for example, we are backing France in the Congo through the EU
               mission, which is very important. We expect reports on the pilot projects in June
               2004.</seg>
            <seg>On the whole, most aspects of the Convention have been seen, elsewhere but not
               here, as a substantial retention of the concept—indeed, perhaps for the first time, a
               proper elaboration of the concept—that as Europe co-operates more it should be on the
               basis of nation states and not on the basis of a federal superstate.</seg>

            <seg>First, I thank my right hon. Friend for what he says about the Agriculture Council,
               which is very important. Clearly, if we had to take matters related to agriculture in

            <seg>In respect of the dislocation, as he describes it, between Europe and the United

               Union-American summit this week we will be able to take significant steps forward
               again for the re-establishment of good relations. The truth is that on issues related
               to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, the middle east peace process and global
               poverty, the EU and the US are on the same side and share the same values. Working
               together, we can achieve a great deal. The general mood of the Council was to make

            <seg>The Prime Minister was rather coy about the list of red line issues that he wants
               removed from the draft constitution. Will he agree, however, that it is rather a long
               list now, including majority voting on criminal laws and procedures and on aspects of
               tax and foreign policy, all of which are in the present draft, as well as the
               compulsory co-ordination of national economic and employment policies, which he did
               not mention, plans for a European public prosecutor, harmonisation of social security
               measures, and late plans for a wholesale transfer from national veto to majority
               voting, without any reference back to national parliaments or people? As he is now
               diverging from his absurd claim that this is just a tidying-up exercise, will he put
               in a public document where and what his red lines are? If he is so confident that he
               can overturn all of them, why does he not have the confidence to put the result to
               the British people in a referendum?</seg>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>I have explained on many occasions why I do not believe that this is a proper
               subject for a referendum. I repeat once again that neither the Single European Act
               nor the Maastricht treaty was put to a referendum by the then Conservative
               Government.</seg>
            <seg>In respect of the right hon. Gentleman's other points, issues remain, of course, in
               relation to tax administration. Let us not forget, however, that, for example, on
               tax, we have effectively won that battle in Europe. In respect of common foreign and
               security policy, we have effectively won that battle. Surely there will still be
               issues that we need to get right, but let us be quite clear about the
               situation.</seg>
            <seg>There are, of course, issues that we must debate here, but the right hon. Gentleman
               will accept that his ideas on the Convention, which I think have been effectively
               agreed by his party today, would mean that Britain would become a different type of
               member of the European Union. That is exactly what he wants; it is a perfectly
               honourable position but a position of which people should be aware. We could end up
               effectively in a situation in which, for example, as he says, a national Parliament
               could effectively veto the application of any issues in its country. People might
               agree with that but there is no way that single market measures could be driven
               though in those circumstances. If we ended up with associate membership of the
               European Union, which he is advocating, it would effectively result in a complete
               change in our relationship with Europe. I think that he has the intellectual honesty
               to admit that and, if it is the case, it represents a fundamental dividing line

               involvement in legislation for the first time. Powers of co-decision will also be
               extended for the European Parliament. The basic issue is that there were those in
               Europe who argued that we should effectively move to some sort of federal superstate.
               That argument has been decisively rejected, which is why it is so important that,
               apart from the British Conservative party—which is, let us say, eccentric on the
               issue—every other country in Europe has accepted that this is indeed a strike against
               federalism and in favour of a Europe of nations. The Conservative party might explode

               majority voting was in the national interest, as it would overcome the protectionist
               instinct of other member countries. Was there a chance at the summit to discuss
               Europe's economic problems and the reform programmes that Germany and France need to

            <seg>We want to respond positively to those claims. Obviously, I had an opportunity to
               discuss that with President Karzai a few weeks ago, and it is worth pointing out that
               when I told him that it is often said here that Afghanistan is in no better shape
               than it was when the Taliban were in charge, his response was that anyone who
               seriously believed that could not have been to the same country that he had been in.
               There have been huge strides forward, but my hon. Friend is absolutely right to
               identify the fact that the problem with security is outside Kabul, which is why we
               are in discussion with Germany and other countries to try to make sure that we extend
               the remit of the security force. We will be taking part in some of the regional teams
               that will try to make sure that the Afghan army is built up sufficiently so that it

               The difference between us is that I do not believe that unless there is a fundamental

               way to proceed. The reason why we have said that we will have a referendum on the
               single currency, should we recommend it, is that it does represent a fundamental
               change in our constitutional arrangements; these proposals do not. Therefore, I do
               not agree that we require a referendum. The reason why I point out that previous
               Conservative Governments did not hold a referendum in those circumstances is to show
