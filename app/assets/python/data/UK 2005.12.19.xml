         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the European
               Council in Brussels on 15–16 December. The main issue at this European Council was
               the European Union budget for 2007–13, the first budget ever for the enlarged Europe
               of 25 member states, soon to become 27 with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
               This country can be proud of the part that we played in the enlargement of the EU.
               The countries of central and eastern Europe that for so long suffered under communist
               dictatorship are now free democracies and   vibrant new members of the EU. To
               have   championed the cause of those new states, to have welcomed them into NATO and
               Europe and then to have refused to agree a budget that protects their future economic
               development would have been a betrayal of everything that Britain has rightly stood
               for in the past 15 years or more since the fall of the Berlin wall. They are our
               allies. It is our duty to stand by them. But it is also massively in our national
               interest. These new member states have fast-growing, open economies, new ideas, human
               capital and a political vision of Europe that is close to ours.</seg>
            <seg>However, although they are catching up economically, they are still much poorer
               than most of the original European Union 15; their people half as   wealthy as in the
               rest of Europe. The purpose of the   budget is rightly to transfer resources from the
               wealthiest west of Europe to the poorer east of Europe. Over the coming years, within
               a broadly stable budget, funds for the new member states will increase from
               €24 billion to €174 billion, a seven-fold increase.</seg>
            <seg>In time, of course, this makes them prosperous and us too. If we look at the
               example of Ireland and Spain, bilateral trade with those countries in goods alone is
               now more than €60 billion a year. Investment in the future prosperity and stability
               of eastern Europe brings big and lasting benefits to this country. The reason that it
               was so important to reach agreement at the European Council is as follows: as all
               central and eastern European leaders made clear to me, it was essential to have a
               December deal to allow those countries to plan and prepare for using the EU funds
               when those funds start in 12 months' time. It was clear that the prospects for a deal
               next year were negligible, and, if there were to be no deal, then in 2007 the
               European Parliament would take over the budget process. That would mean the
               Parliament setting annual budgets, on the existing financial agreements, which would
               have meant that countries such as Poland would have lost around two thirds of their
               EU funds. That is why they wanted a deal now. Of course, there is also a need for
               fundamental reform of the EU budget. As I said in June, what we need is to settle the
               budget on the basis of everyone paying their fair share of the costs of enlargement
               now; and then to open up the prospect of a radically reformed budget midway through
               the next budget period. The agreement reached on Saturday morning differed from that
               of the Luxembourg proposal in four key respects. The overall budget is smaller. The
               proposal in June was that the UK rebate should be reduced in commitment terms by
               about €22.5 billion; under this deal, the maximum we shall pay is €10.5 billion. In
               the review clause in June, the common agricultural policy agreement of 2002 was
               specifically endorsed. Now it is clear that all aspects of the budget can be examined
               in 2008–09. However, crucially for Britain, this agreement states expressly — unlike
               that of June — that the British rebate remains in full on all expenditure in the
               original 15 member states. It remains in full on all common agricultural policy
               market expenditure everywhere in the Union, including in the new member states. We
               have, however, agreed to disapply a proportion of the rebate on structural and
               cohesion spending in the new member states — in effect, on the spending directly
               designed for economic development. As I have said, the cost of this is up to a
               maximum of €10.5 billion or about £7 billion over the next seven years of the
               financing period. Moreover, because the rebate stays on all common agricultural
               policy and all spending in the original European 15, the rebate will rise, not fall,
               to an average of €5.8 billion in payments terms annually from 2007. Overall, the
               rebate will get us about €41 billion back in the next budget period — substantially
               more than in this period. That is then the crucial leverage for future reform.</seg>
            <seg>As the strongest supporter of enlargement among all member states, I strongly
               believe that it was right — indeed, essential — that the UK should contribute
               properly to enlargement. The fact is that if we support and, indeed, drive through a
               policy of ending the post-war division of Europe, we have to be ready to accept our
               fair share of the costs of that policy. Enlargement was never, and could never be, a
               cost-free policy, and this Government are prepared to shoulder their responsibilities
               in this area, because it is the right   thing to do. In this context, I want to
               dispel one misunderstanding that has arisen — the impression that only the UK is
               contributing to the costs of enlargement. All wealthier countries are contributing.
               In terms of net contributions, our contribution will increase by 63 per cent. over
               the next financing period in comparison with 2000–06. France's contribution will
               increase by 124 per cent. Italy's contribution will increase by 126 per cent. Spain
               will lose in the region of €40 billion. Moreover, after some 20 years of our paying,
               under the original rebate, twice as much as France, UK and French contributions will,
               from 2007, for the first time, be in rough parity. Because the UK economy is now
               bigger than the French economy, we will, in fact, on the Commission's figures, be
               contributing a smaller share of our national wealth.</seg>
            <seg>Alongside this agreement on support for the modernisation of eastern Europe, we
               also agreed on a fundamental review of all aspects of the EU budget, including the
               common agricultural policy, to be led by President Barroso, with the recommendation
               that it begin in 2008. As the language in the European Council conclusions makes
               absolutely clear, it is then possible for changes to be made to this budget structure
               in the course of this financing period. This will also allow us to take account of
               any changes agreed in the World Trade Organisation round, including the decision to
               phase out all export subsidies for agriculture by 2013. In addition, it was agreed
               that any CAP spending for Romania and Bulgaria — about €8 billion — should be fitted
               within existing CAP ceilings, which is a significant budgetary discipline.</seg>
            <seg>So to summarise, when people ask what we got for agreeing to pay our fair share of
               enlargement, the answer is an agreement that sees us, for the first time since we
               joined the EU, paying no more than similar countries, such as France and Italy; the
               rebate staying put on all CAP spending and rising, not falling, in value; and a
               process that can, in the years to come, lead to the necessary fundamental reform of
               both rebate and CAP that we all want to see.</seg>
            <seg>I should report briefly that the Council also agreed on a strategic partnership
               between the European Union and Africa, on a new and strengthened policy on illegal
               migration and on a counter-terrorism plan. We also agreed that Macedonia should be
               granted candidate status — the next step in its path towards membership of   the
               European Union. As a strong supporter of Macedonia's ambitions, I want to
               congratulate the Macedonian Government on the progress that they have made towards
               that goal.</seg>
            <seg>The European Council also unreservedly condemned the Iranian President's recent
               remarks about Israel and warmly welcomed the 15 December elections in Iraq as a
               further step towards democracy and stability in that country. Over the past six
               months, the UK presidency has delivered the historic launch of accession negotiations </seg>

            <seg>It has delivered the launch of accession negotiations with Turkey and Croatia — a
               long-standing British objective. We have delivered a number of important pieces of
               legislation, including the REACH — registration, evaluation, authorisation and
               restriction of chemicals — regulations and the data retention directive, which is an
               important measure against terrorism. We have delivered reform of the EU sugar regime
               and a strengthening of the EU position on climate change</seg>

         <u who="#SPEAKER">
            <seg>Order. Mr. Bellingham, you are out of order, and you are not the only one. After
               the Prime Minister has finished, I shall seek to protect the Leader of the
               Opposition, and I cannot do that if hon. Members are shouting at the Prime
               Minister.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>And we have delivered an EU budget deal that is €160 billion cheaper than the
               original Commission proposals, provides for a huge transfer of spending from the
               original 15 to the new member states of eastern Europe, and preserves the British
               rebate in full on the CAP and all spending in the   EU 15. I commend all this to the
               House.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>This was the year that Europe needed to change direction; this was the year that
               the people of Europe rejected the constitution; and this was the year that people
               called for the end of the obscenity of protectionism that damages the developing
               world. The Prime Minister rightly talked at the time of a crisis in European
               leadership, so the question for him is whether the British presidency and the new
               budget even begin to measure up to those challenges.</seg>
            <seg>We warmly welcome the accession talks with Turkey and Croatia. We welcome what the
               Prime Minister said about Macedonia and the EU partnership with Africa, but has not
               progress elsewhere been desperately slow?</seg>
            <seg>On the budget, does the Prime Minister remember having three clear objectives:
               first, to limit its size, when almost every country in Europe is taxing and borrowing
               too much; secondly, to ensure fundamental reform of the CAP; and, thirdly, to keep
               the British rebate unless such reform occurs? Is it not now clear that he failed in
               every single one?</seg>
            <seg>First, the Prime Minister said that he wanted the size of the budget to be set at
               1 per cent. of Europe's income. Can he confirm that the budget that he has just
               agreed is higher than that, higher than the compromise that he tabled and will mean
               £25 billion in extra spending? The Prime Minister says that that is intended to pay
               for enlargement, so will he confirm that Ireland, which is richer per capita than
               Britain, is getting more per head than Lithuania, Slovakia and Poland?</seg>
            <seg>Secondly, the Prime Minister wanted to change the things that the budget was spent
               on. Is it not clear that he has failed to do that as well? Is it not the case that
               CAP spending will be higher next year, the year after that and in every year up to
               2013? The Chancellor said that CAP reform was necessary to make poverty history. The
               Prime Minister told the House in June that he wanted to get rid of the CAP. Will he
               confirm that, four months later, his own Europe Minister said that the Government had
               not made any detailed proposals to reform the CAP? Is it not the case that the entire
               Government spent four years doing nothing about something that the Prime Minister
               thought was essential?</seg>
            <seg>Will the Prime Minister be clear about what he has secured on the CAP? It is a
               review and it takes place in 2008. Can he confirm that, in that year, the presidency
               will be held by France? Is he aware that the French Foreign Minister has said that
               Jacques Chirac has secured that there will be no reform to the common agricultural
               policy before 2014? Is that not the opposite of what the Prime Minister actually
               wanted? In other words, he has completely failed to deliver CAP reform.</seg>
            <seg>What about the Prime Minister's third objective: if all else fails, keep the
               rebate? All else did fail, and the Prime Minister's position was clear. He used to
               say the rebate was non-negotiable. He said at that Dispatch Box in June: <quote>"The
                  UK rebate will remain and we will not negotiate it away. Period."</quote>
               <bibl type="source">Official Report, 8 June 2005; Vol. 434, c. 1234.</bibl> The
               Chancellor said that it was non-negotiable and fully justified. Then the Prime
               Minister changed his mind. The rebate could be negotiated, he said, provided that
               there was fundamental reform of the CAP. So it was clear that the only circumstances
               in which the rebate would be given up was if there were a commensurate and equal
               giving up of farm subsidies.</seg>
            <seg>That is not an unreasonable position and, at that time, he knew all about the other
               considerations he mentioned today, including the importance of supporting
               enlargement. But what happened? The farm subsidies remain and £7 billion of the
               rebate has been negotiated away. If that was always the Government's plan, why was
               not any reduction in the rebate in the Chancellor's pre-Budget report? We are told
               that the Chancellor did not even know about the final deal. Normally, it is the
               Chancellor who does not tell the Prime Minister about what is in the Budget; this
               time the Prime Minister did not tell the Chancellor.</seg>
            <seg>Can the Prime Minister confirm that, by 2011, the UK will be losing £2 billion a
               year and that that will be the baseline from which we negotiate? Will he confirm that
               the amount he has given up from the rebate is almost double our entire overseas aid
               budget this year?</seg>
            <seg>In June, the Prime Minister told the House that no deal was better than a bad deal.
               He said: <quote>"Europe's credibility demands the right deal — not the usual
                  cobbled-together compromise in the early hours of the morning."</quote>
               <bibl type="source">Official Report, 20 June 2005; Vol. 435, c. 524.</bibl> Did he
               remember that when he was cobbling together this compromise in the early hours of the
               morning? Why did he give up £7 billion for next to nothing? Vitally, how is the
               Chancellor going to pay for it — more taxes, more borrowing or cuts in spending?
               Which is it?</seg>
            <seg>A good budget deal would have limited spending; it would have reformed the CAP and
               it would have helped change Europe's direction. Is it not the case that none of those
               things happened under the British presidency? Europe needed to be led in a new
               direction. Are we not simply heading in the same direction but paying a bigger

               wealthy countries will therefore pay to the poorer countries, and we are a wealthy

            <seg>As the Prime Minister knows, the Liberal Democrat party has consistently supported
               the enlargement of the EU and welcomes that development, which, following the
               collapse of the Berlin wall, is good for us in Europe and for the world generally. I
               acknowledge that that development must come with a financial price tag in order to
               meet moral, political and economic objectives. Having achieved a degree of expansion,
               we also welcome the opening of accession talks with Turkey and Croatia and the
               approval of candidate status for Macedonia in this presidency.</seg>
            <seg>G</seg>
            <seg>iven the ideals that the Prime Minister properly set out at the beginning of the UK
               presidency, there is a great deal of disappointment with its conclusion, not least
               where common agricultural policy reform is concerned. First, is not the truth of the
               matter that the stitch-up between France and Germany over CAP reform, to which the
               Prime Minister had to put his name, that took place two years ago is what has made
               the British position so difficult today?</seg>
            <seg>Secondly, the French managed to call his bluff on the issue at the summit. The
               Prime Minister has said: <quote>"and then to open up the prospect of a radically
                  reformed Budget midway through the next Budget period."</quote> The French Foreign
               Minister has said that there will be no reform of CAP before 2013.</seg>
            <seg>Those two statements do not marry up. Will the Prime Minister confirm that when the
               much-vaunted review takes place, it will consist of a review by the Commission, which
               will result in a document being submitted to a subsequent Council of Ministers, which
               will decide the matter? The review carries no more force or persuasiveness than
               that.</seg>
            <seg>In terms of pursuing long-term British interests, albeit that this has been a
               somewhat disappointing presidency, does the Prime Minister agree that disengagement
               within the European Parliament or elsewhere is a recipe for absolute disaster? This
               at a time when someone is making speeches about pursuing a green environmental
               agenda; indeed, Europe is a very logical place to pursue that. In the last European
               Parliament, the British Conservatives held the chairmanship of the Environment
               Committee. If they pursue their current course of action, they will not hold the
               chairmanships of any committees. That will be a loss not only for them but for
               Britain.</seg>
            <seg>The outcomes of this summit are disappointing but not disastrous. It deserves to be
               particularly disappointing for those Eurosceptics who want to see Britain fragmented
               from Europe, rather than Europe succeeding in the longer term.</seg>

            <seg> </seg>
            <seg>I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his general welcome for what we have done. One
               can only imagine what would have happened had we failed to reach a budget deal this
               December in terms of our relationships with the central and eastern European
               countries who are our allies, and of course with other new Governments, not least the
               German Government.</seg>
            <seg>The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to draw attention to what was said in
               June. I would repeat what I said in this House, if I may, when I reported from the
               Brussels Council: <quote>"I proposed that we have a fundamental review of the EU
                  budget, reporting in time for us to be able — midway through the next financial
                  period — to alter fundamentally the structure of the budget, dealing both with the
                  rebate and the CAP."</quote> I went on to say: <quote>"In the meantime, of course,
                  we would ensure that we paid our fair share of enlargement."</quote>
               <bibl type="source">Official Report, 20 June 2005; Vol.   435, c. 524</bibl>
            </seg>
            <seg>The position is very clear. The opportunity to get the fundamental reform will come
               through the review. Twelve other countries joined with France in saying that they do
               not wish to disturb the CAP deal that was done in 2002. Of course, had we not been
               able to conclude that deal in 2002, enlargement would not have happened, because that
               summit concerned enlargement in respect of future spending. It is worth pointing out
               to people who criticise the deal reached in 2002 that, without it, we would never
               have got those countries coming into the European Union in 2004.</seg>
            <seg>As the right hon. Gentleman said, there will, however, be a major battle when the
               review is published. As the President of the Commission made clear today, it will be
               a fundamental review of what the money is spent on and how it should be spent. It
               will also, of course, be about a proper and sensible way of deciding that according
               to wealth people should pay, and according to need they should receive. The one thing
               that is obvious is that the   budget does indeed need fundamental change, but   the
               whole point about getting this deal in December is that, without it, the new central
               and eastern European countries could not have planned ahead for the next budget
               period. That is why we had to have an immediate deal in December so that they could
               have the certainty of the money coming to them, and then, in the medium and longer
               term, the prospect of the mid-term review that would allow us fundamentally to change
               the structure of the budget.</seg>
            <seg>The right hon. Gentleman is right that there will be a   huge battle between the
               reformers and the non-reformers. But who are our allies in the reform struggle? They
               are the very countries in central and eastern Europe that, if we had not done a deal,
               would have been completely alienated from this country. No one should be in any doubt
               about that. After our ding-dong, I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition that it
               is important for the Conservatives to think very carefully about their position of
               withdrawing from the EPP. That would be a disaster in terms of this country being
               able to procure a good deal in Europe.</seg>

               including research and development and innovation. Even though the CAP has come down
               in the last 20 years from about 70 per cent. of the budget to 40 per cent., that
               still means that 40 per cent. of the budget is spent on 2 or, at most, 4 per cent. of

               there is absolutely no way that we will be able to get that reformed and restructured

               share of the costs of enlargement. Over the budget period, the result of giving up a

               maximum cost of €10.5 billion. Once the increased budget is taken into account over

               going to be a shortfall in respect of Treasury expectations and the lost rebate. Will

               Gentleman said that he does not agree with paying any money toward enlargement, which

               during the next budget period a sum twice the size of the post-war Marshall plan in

            <seg> I thank my hon. Friend for that question and she is right to say that there will
               be a big transfer of money, but there are other interesting points to note about the
               central and eastern European countries. For example, my conversations with the Prime
               Minister of Estonia and with representatives of many of the other central and eastern
               European countries showed that they believe that they will very quickly become net
               contributors to the European budget. Their economies are doing extremely well, they
               are expanding quickly and they are massive economic reformers. What all of them
               therefore need is this seed corn investment, which allows them to grow quickly. In
               time, of course, the result will be a massive increase in trade between those
               countries and this country. That is an example of the way in which the European Union
               has granted us such prosperity over the years.</seg>

         <u who="#CURRY">
            <seg>What steps can the Prime Minister take to ensure that the Doha trade round does not
               drift into failure in the early months of next year? Can he assure us that the
               2008 expenditure review will not prevent the European Union from making a new offer
               on agricultural subsidies a great deal earlier than that, given that, in the light of
               world prices, the abolition of export rebates is a relatively low-cost option?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg> I actually think that the opposite is true. Obviously, it is important that we do
               everything we can to secure progress in the Doha trade round, and that requires
               action by the European Union, the United States and Japan, as well as by Brazil,
               India and the other emerging economies. The review allows us to be in the position of
               saying that we are going to need fundamental reform in order to meet our trade
               obligations. The Doha round, even if it is fully successful, will not create
               immediate agricultural reform: it will set that reform out over a period of time. For
               example, export subsidies will be phased out by 2013. That helps us to get a better
               deal in the mid-term review for Europe as well as the individual countries.</seg>

               creative accountancy, to undermine this country's manufacturing base?</seg>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg> I assure my hon. Friend that the rules that apply mean that the economic
               development of those countries must take account of the criteria set out for all
               spending of structural and cohesion funds. However, there is a bigger positive for
               us. Those countries will increase in wealth and growth quickly, and that will be a
               market for our manufacturing industry.</seg>

         <u who="#LEIGH">
            <seg>Would it be a fair summary to say that originally we were not going to give up any
               of the rebate, then we would give it up only for fundamental reform of the CAP, and
               now we will give it up to pay for enlargement? If that is not the case, what concrete
               reforms will there be of the CAP before 2013? Would it not have been more honest of
               the Prime Minister to have come to the House and said that to us six months
               ago?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg> I have just read out what I said six months ago, and that is not an accurate
               summary of what I said. The rebate will rise in value and we will receive more back
               in the rebate in the next financial period than in the last. The rebate will remain
               on all   agricultural spending. The rebate will remain on all spending in the
               original European 15. But we cannot say that those poorer countries should pay the
               rebate in respect of the money going to their economic development. Otherwise we
               would not be doing what I said in June that we should, which is in the meantime —
               before the fundamental CAP reform takes place — to pay our fair share of the costs of
               enlargement. If we had refused to do that, there would have been no budget deal and
               there would have been crisis in all the central and eastern European states, and we
               would have been blamed for that. That would not have been very sensible
               negotiating.</seg>

            <seg>My right hon. Friend rightly pointed out that our natural allies in central Europe

               betrayed our own national interest in not getting a deal, with whom would we have
               negotiated in the European Parliament and with whom would a future Tory Government

            <seg> As I understand it, the position of the Opposition is that they would withdraw

               the most serious repercussions for this country's ability to make its influence felt,
               which is no doubt why the previous leaders of the Conservative party, including the

            <seg> The right hon. Gentleman and I   just have a fundamental disagreement about
               Europe. I happen to believe that having championed the cause of enlargement it would
               be absurd for this country to say that we were not prepared to pay for it. That is
               our position. He apparently wishes to support enlargement but would refuse to have
               anything to do with paying for it. I would say that that is a ridiculous position.
               Sometimes it is actually better to have a situation in which we work with our allies
               to secure a proper deal, which will mean — as I said earlier — that France will
               actually pay more than us in the difference between their net contributions in the
               next period compared with the last. It is better to do such a deal than to end up
               alienating every ally in Europe and getting nothing for this country.</seg>
