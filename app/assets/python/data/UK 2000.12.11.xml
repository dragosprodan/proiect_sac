         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>After five gruelling days, victory was secured - I am sure the whole House would
               like to send our congratulations to the English cricket team on its triumph. With
               permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall make a statement on the European Council which took
               place from 7 to 10 December. A copy of the conclusions has been placed in the Library
               of the House, and a copy of the Nice treaty will be deposited as soon as the final
               version is available from the Council secretariat. This summit was the culmination of
               a year-long conference called to deal with issues on which agreement could not be
               reached at Amsterdam three and a half years ago. Agreement was essential to open the
               door to the enlargement of the European Union, the goal of successive British
               Governments. An agreement was reached in the early hours of this morning which
               removes all remaining institutional obstacles to enlargement. It is extraordinary to
               think that, a few years ago, those countries in central and eastern Europe were still
               under the communist yoke of the old Soviet bloc. Today, there is the real prospect of
               uniting western and eastern Europe for the first time in generations. The primary
               objective in the negotiation has therefore been successfully accomplished. But there
               were also key British interests. Our first priority was to get more voting strength
               for the United Kingdom. The agreement reached increases the weight of Britain's vote.
               It raises the threshold for qualified majority voting up, when the EU comprises 27
               members, to more than 74 per cent. of votes. It adds two further tests. Any proposal
               must have at least a majority of states on-side, as well as crossing the 74 per cent.
               threshold. And a new population threshold at 62 per cent. of the EU is also
               introduced. So the three biggest countries will continue, even as the EU enlarges, to
               be able to block together. This now can be placed alongside the changes in Britain's
               financial contributions. Ever since we joined the EU, Britain has made a far greater
               proportionate contribution to Europe's finances than France or Italy despite, until
               recently, being a slightly smaller economy. By 2006, on the assumption of only six
               new member states, we shall be making a net contribution roughly equivalent to France
               and Italy's, for the first time in our membership. Secondly, on defence, the European
               Council agreed the arrangements for European security that we have been negotiating
               over the past two years. It was made plain, first, that European defence would
               operate only when NATO chooses not to be engaged; secondly, that it be limited to
               peacekeeping, humanitarian and crisis management tasks; and, thirdly, as the text
               puts it, that the commitment of national assets to any EU-led operation will be based
               on "sovereign national decisions." Collective defence will remain the responsibility
               of NATO. The next step is for the two organisations, the EU and NATO, to agree on the
               necessary arrangements. Any significant operation will require NATO assets and any
               such operation will be planned at NATO by the planning staff at Supreme Headquarters
               Allied Powers Europe- <seg>This underlines the EU's aim to develop a strategic
                  partnership with NATO. So here, too, Britain's essential national interest has
                  been protected.</seg> Thirdly, we have retained unanimity where necessary and
               extended qualified majority voting where necessary. Of the articles that move to QMV,
               11 deal with appointments or changes in rules of procedure. One of these is important
               - the nomination of the Commission President, where it is essential that, in an EU of
               27 or 30, one small state cannot block the right appointment. Nine of the changes
               deal with freedom of movement where we - that is, Britain - have an absolute right to
               decide whether to take part or not, thanks to the protocol that we secured at
               Amsterdam. The remaining changes are primarily about the efficiency of economic
               management and the single market, where majority voting is in this country's national
               interest: financial management of the EU budget, industrial policy, trade in
               services. All that means new markets for Britain's financial services and the jobs
               and prosperity that go with them. And within even these articles, we have kept
               unanimity where we need it: unanimity in respect of harmonisation and anti-
               discrimination measures, unanimity for passports, unanimity for anything to do with
               taxation and social security. There were areas where it would not have been in our
               interests to agree to any QMV, in particular for taxation and social security. As we
               undertook to the House, those matters will remain subject to unanimity. In the field
               of justice and home affairs, the special protocol that we agreed at Amsterdam
               continues to mean that we - Britain - decide where to join in co-operation in our
               national interest, for example, in dealing with problems of asylum. On all these
               issues, we said that we would protect the national interest and, contrary to the dire
               warnings of the Conservative party, that is exactly what we did. The House will note
               with some amusement the Tories claims now that those issues were never under threat.
               In an enlarged European Union, there will inevitably be issues on which member states
               can move ahead faster than others. It is in Britain's interests, as one of the
               leading partners of the EU, for that to be possible. We have secured conditions for
               this co-operation which fully safeguard the single market, prevent discrimination in
               trade between member states, cannot conflict with existing agreements, and are open
               to all. In the field of foreign policy, the common strategies of the Union, however,
               will continue to be set by unanimity. Any co-operation between groups of member
               states has to be consistent with a prior agreement reached by all, and is therefore
               subject to the national veto if necessary. These enhanced co-operation agreements,
               incidentally, will not apply to defence - another key British objective. On numbers
               of Commissioners, those are unchanged up to 2005, except for one for any applicant
               country. Then, from 2006, there will be one Commissioner per country, up to a maximum
               of 27 - at present there are 20 - with an agreement to reduce numbers in 2010,
               following a review. Since the Amsterdam summit of three and a half years ago, we have
               tried to rebuild British policy in Europe to get the best out of Europe for Britain
               while shaping Europe's future. On each occasion, we were told that it was impossible:
               that Britain  Europe was the only game in town. At Amsterdam, we were told we could
               not protect our borders. We did. Two years ago, in Berlin, we were told we could not
               protect the British rebate. We did better; we put Britain's contributions on a more
               equitable footing for the first time. At Lisbon, we were told Europe could not accept
               the agenda for economic reforms. It did. Earlier this year, at the June summit, we
               were told we could not win the argument on the withholding tax. It is won. The rest
               of Europe is now going to adopt exchange of information, not a new tax, as the way
               forward. Finally, on defence, we were told that we could not improve Europe's defence
               capability - a vital NATO as well as EU interest - without undermining NATO, and that
               we would be isolated on tax and social security. We secured those objectives without
               its even being suggested that we were an obstacle in the way of enlargement. It is
               possible, in our judgment, to fight Britain's corner, get the best out of Europe for
               Britain and exercise real authority and influence in Europe. That is as it should be.
               Britain is a world power. To stand aside from the key alliance - the European Union -
               right on our doorstep, is not advancing Britain's interests; it is betraying British
               interests. Enlargement will now happen. British interests were advanced, but we
               cannot continue to take decisions as important as this in this way. That is not a
               criticism of the French presidency, which did well in immensely difficult
               circumstances, but the ideas for future reform in the European Union which Britain
               put forward a few weeks ago are now essential so that a more rational way of decision
               making is achieved. This, too, is a debate in which we should be thoroughly and
               constructively engaged; and we will be. The Europe that this Government are striving
               for is one of nation states with their own traditions, cultures and special interests
               which work together in their own interests and in those of Europe as a whole. That
               means, on the one hand, making common decisions at a European level where that makes
               sense and, on the other hand, making decisions at a national or, indeed, regional
               level where that makes sense. It means embracing all the countries of Europe - east
               and west - in a way that would have been unimaginable throughout most of the troubled
               history of our continent. That is a goal that moved significantly forward at the Nice
               summit. I commend its conclusions to the House.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#HAGUE">
            <seg>Is not the truth, when we cut through the spin, that the agreement represents three
               more major steps to a European superstate? First, the Prime Minister has signed away
               the veto in 23 new areas - in fact, one Government official put the number of new
               areas that could now be decided by majority vote as high as 39. By doing that, has
               the Prime Minister not granted European institutions the opportunity to impose
               further integration in future? Will not a court that reinterpreted the working time
               directive as a health and safety measure now use the further loss of the veto to
               impose precisely the sort of regulation that could cost jobs in this country in
               future? Will not the loss of the veto on structural funds mean that future
               Governments will not be able to stop British regions losing money? Will not the
               weakening of the veto on the environment mean further interference in town and
               country planning? However much it is hemmed about by ambiguous language, how does the
               Prime Minister think the European Court will interpret the clause allowing Europe to
               fund states in severe difficulties because of so-called "exceptional occurrences" now
               that he has signed away our veto on that? Could it not be seriously against this
               country's interests no longer to have a veto over the appointment of the Commission
               President? Will the Prime Minister confirm that he has abandoned the veto on groups
               of countries integrating more closely - so-called "enhanced co-operation" - and that
               we cannot stop them, even when our national interest is being harmed? Can he confirm
               that the EU will now be able to fund European political parties directly, without a
               national veto? Does not all that represent a major step toward European integration
               and does not the charter of fundamental rights represent the second major step toward
               that superstate? Everyone but the Prime Minister has been open about what the charter
               will lead to, irrespective of whether it is in the treaties. The European Commission
               says: It can reasonably be expected that the Charter will become mandatory through
               the Court's interpretation of it as belonging to the general principles of Community
               law.</seg>
            <seg>The Commission's website asks:<quote>Will the Charter lead to a large rise in the
                  number of law suits...?</quote> and answers: <quote>This cannot be
                  excluded...,</quote> adding that the charter of fundamental rights means that
                  <quote>the European Union has entered a new, more resolutely political stage of
                  integration. The Charter will be a very important milestone on the road towards
                  this political Europe.</quote> Does not the move to a Euro-army represent the
               third step to such a superstate? Has not the Prime Minister signed up at Nice to an
               independent and autonomous European identity, with only ad hoc arrangements linking
               it to NATO? Is it not the case that duplicate and conflicting structures are being
               set up? Does not annexe 7 of the draft presidency report, which has just been
               released, refer on defence matters to the autonomy of EU decision making, to the EU
               and NATO dealing with each other on an equal footing, and to the EU Council adopting
               strategic options with NATO... informed of developments in the situation...?</seg>
            <seg>As currently constituted, the EU defence force will progressively move away from
               NATO. Is that not why President Chirac said that the force would be independent of
               the alliance's headquarters, why British Government officials said that his remarks
               were a statement of the obvious, and why former United States Assistant Defence
               Secretary Richard Perle describes the Nice agreement as <quote>"a catastrophe for
                  NATO"</quote> and <quote>"a British defeat"</quote>?</seg>
            <seg>If this is a European army - and it is - what is the point of inserting sentences
               in the communique saying otherwise? Is not the real reason revealed this morning in a
               German newspaper? It states that Because the advance election campaign has begun in
               Great Britain, the chiefs decided to insert the army secretly... to play down its
               establishment as much as possible... Blair and Chirac... saw to it that a real step
               by the Europeans towards more integration was concealed. So Nice represents three
               major steps towards a more deeply integrated Europe. It has ended up being about
               integration rather than enlargement. Reweighting the votes and limiting the size of
               the Commission are important for enlargement, but they are not enough. Surely a
               summit genuinely about enlargement would have tried to reform the greatest obstacle
               of all to enlargement, which is the common agricultural policy. Surely a summit
               genuinely about enlargement would have introduced real flexibility, returning more
               decision making over new laws to the nation states of the EU. Surely a treaty
               genuinely about enlargement would have meant less integration, not more.</seg>
            <seg>If the Prime Minister is worried that Europe will not be able to force through as
               much legislation in future, why is the answer not less legislation in future?
               Continuing the relentless ratchet of integration makes successful enlargement less
               likely, not more likely. It is not surprising, therefore, that there is no clear
               commitment in the communique to entry dates for the applicant countries, as President
               Chirac has made clear. It is not surprising either that, with Europe moving in this
               direction, the Prime Minister has agreed to yet another summit, whose purpose will be
               to start drafting a Euro-constitution, which in the words of the German-Italian paper
               on this subject, will be with a view to the further development of European
               integration...?</seg>
            <seg>The Prime Minister emerged with a treaty that takes Europe in the wrong direction,
               and a Conservative Government will not ratify it as it stands. If the Government wish
               to sign up to the three major steps, including the charter of rights and the European
               army, they should first consult the people of this country in a referendum. The Prime
               Minister has missed the best opportunity of his premiership to put the case for the
               sort of Europe that is supported by the majority of people in the United Kingdom. He
               has missed that opportunity because that is not the sort of Europe in which he
               believes. Instead, the summit has represented three more major steps on the road to a
               superstate. It will be up to us, the Opposition, to put the case for a different
               direction, for a modern, reformed and flexible Europe. It will be for us to put the
               case for a European Union that is right for Britain and for Europe as a whole; and to
               put the case for being in Europe, not run by Europe.</seg>

            <seg>I preferred the right hon. Gentleman with the jokes. What he is saying about
               qualified majority voting is extraordinary. Nine of the measures relating to justice
               and home affairs come within our protocol protection. As for 11 of the other
               articles, we have, for example, the appointment of the Deputy Secretary-General of
               the Council, the pension arrangements for the registrar of the court and the approval
               of the rules of procedure of the Court of Auditors. Should we have blocked the
               enlargement treaty for these things? It is ridiculous.</seg>
            <seg>As for what the right hon. Gentleman says about the Commission President, it is
               vital for our interests that we do not end up in a situation where, as the EU
               enlarges, that appointment can be blocked by one small member state. Did we not learn
               that when the Conservative party was in power and the Commission President before
               last was appointed? Let us just say that, as a result of the rules, there were many
               candidates at the time whom it would have been a good idea to have had forward in the
               frame, but we were not able to do that. That is a classic example of what I am
               saying. There are certain areas - for example, trade in services - where Britain has
               to take on other countries and secure unanimity. It finds that it cannot do so
               because another country blocks the approach, for various protectionist reasons.
               Qualified majority voting allows us to proceed in that way. It cannot be that QMV is
               always in other countries' interests but not in ours. The shadow Foreign Secretary
               said a couple of days ago, which I know is quite a long time in policy-making
               terms:</seg>
            <quote>I don't have a doctrinal view that any qualified majority voting is wrong, we
               signed up for it to complete the single market.</quote>
            <seg>Presumably, the difference is simply which areas he would block - the rules of
               procedure of the Court of Auditors? It is absurd. I shall deal with some of the
               factual points. The right hon. Gentleman said that he was opposed to moving to QMV,
               although the move to QMV for the social and cohesion funds - the structural funds -
               is not for some years to come. It is hugely in this country's interest to have QMV
               there. At present we cannot get a proper deal on structural and cohesion funds
               because there are certain interests, mainly in the south of Europe, that block it via
               unanimity. If we were able to move to QMV, we would get a better deal for this
               country. In the course of the negotiation, I was arguing that we should move to QMV
               quicker, because it was in our interest to move there more quickly. The right hon.
               Gentleman mentioned countries in financial difficulties. That is subject to the
               budget ceilings that exist, and there is no bale-out in respect of the euro, because
               that is secured in another article under the Chancellor's negotiation. Incidentally,
               the right hon. Gentleman mentioned the support for European political parties. I
               point out to him that that was requested by the European People's Party, which is the
               association of European political parties and of which his party is a member - but
               let us leave that to one side. In relation to enhanced co-operation, the right hon.
               Gentleman says that he is in favour of a more flexible Europe, but he opposes the
               idea of enhanced co-operation, which means that if countries want to, they can go
               ahead, and other countries have a choice whether to join. Surely that is the very
               flexibility that he is talking about. The right hon. Gentleman goes on about the
               charter of fundamental rights. The reason the Commission is asking for it to have
               legal status is that it does not have legal status. Our case is that it should not
               have legal status, and we do not intend it to. We will have to fight that case. When
               the right hon. Gentleman speaks of the word "integration" being wrong in respect of
               any European treaty, does he not remember the Maastricht treaty and the Single
               European Act? One can go back to any European treaty and find the word mentioned
               there. On the Euro-army, we reach the realms of the right hon. Gentleman's fantasies.

            <seg>Shall I go on? The report continues:</seg>
            <quote>This does not involve the establishment of a European army. The commitment of
               national resources by member states to such operations will be based on their
               sovereign decisions. As regards the member states, NATO remains the basis of our
               collective defence.</quote>
            <seg>I have an even better supporter on my side. Here is what the shadow Foreign
               Secretary said two days ago:</seg>
            <quote>If NATO decides it doesn't want to do it, then obviously this can go

            <seg>That is precisely what the proposal is, but the Opposition still say that they do
               not support it. The Leader of the Opposition commented on the common agricultural
               policy, and it is right that far more reform of the CAP is needed. The difficulty is
               that that must be done by unanimity, so that is a problem, but none the less we did
               our very best, and we did get significant changes. That was the topic at the previous
               negotiation, in Berlin. We have achieved more in the reform of the common
               agricultural policy than the right hon. Gentleman ever did when he was in office. As
               for the idea of a future intergovernmental conference, it will deal primarily with
               the issue of subsidiarity. Again, that is a major British interest, which we should
               support. We have set out why we believe the treaty to be in the interests of this
               country and in the interests of Europe. The right hon. Gentleman has again stated
               firmly from the Dispatch Box today that he would block the treaty. Let me explain the
               full rounded idiocy of the position that the right hon. Gentleman has got himself
               into. He is saying that he would not have agreed any treaty unless everyone agreed to
               what he calls his pick-and-choose policy on future legislation. Is it not right that
               that is Conservative policy? I have asked the right hon. Gentleman this question
               before, and perhaps I can get an answer now that the European summit is over. Will he
               name one country that supports the proposal, when all 15 have to support it? Let us
               have silence, so that he can shout out the answer. The right hon. Gentleman would
               need the other 14 to agree, but he cannot name one. Let us try this. Will the right
               hon. Gentleman name one other Conservative party in Europe that supports his
               proposal? The right hon. Gentleman is saying that he would go to the Council and say
               that, unless Britain has a pick-and-choose policy, he would block the treaty.
               However, he is also saying that he would block flexibility for everyone else. That
               would be a pretty intelligent policy, would it not? The right hon. Gentleman says
               that he would have no QMV at all but that, it there were any QMV, he would have a
               referendum in the UK. By the end of that process, he would have alienated every
               country in the European Union and every country waiting to come into it. If he had
               been negotiating, he would have come back today saying either that he had blocked
               enlargement - which would be a great thing for Britain to have in its history and
               tradition - or that he had agreed QMV on the court registrar's' pension and was going
               to hold a referendum on it. I am sorry, but that is the right hon. Gentleman's
               policy. We did not have a referendum on the Single European Act or Maastricht. The
               right hon. Gentleman is not even offering the British people a referendum on the
               single currency. However, on the question of the vital strategic interest of the
               pension of the court officials, we would all be trooping off to the polling stations.
               Does the right hon. Gentleman want to be taken seriously by anyone in Britain, Europe
               or elsewhere? The true agenda of a large part of his party - and the Conservative
               party will stay in this position until the right hon. Gentleman confronts this - is
               to have this country next door to the exit sign in Europe. That would be a disaster
               for Britain and Europe. It is wrong, and we shall not do it. We shall win the
               argument, because that is in the true national interest of Britain.</seg>

               should be complimented on maintaining the British veto in areas on which Labour and

               having fought that war against ethnic cleansing, we do not see ethnic cleansing being
               visited on Serbs by the other side. We are acutely conscious of that. Of course,
               Kosovo is not such an example - it is important to say that. The rapid reaction force
               is not, I repeat, a standing army; it is merely a capability that we should have. It
               is limited to the so-called Petersberg tasks, which are peacekeeping and humanitarian
               missions. It would not be used to fight, for example, the Kosovo conflict or the Gulf
               war. However, it could, for example, be used for peacekeeping operations in

               improper about that remark. It is consistent with French policy since President de

               to rejoin it and since President Mitterrand refused at the beginning of the Gulf war
               to allow French troops to come under American command. Is it any surprise, therefore,
               that the French have a different objective and that, whatever might have been in the
               communique, there remain very real difficulties ahead?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>It is right - I choose my words carefully - that France comes from a different
               tradition in respect of such things, especially in respect of attitudes to NATO, but
               that is precisely why we have made sure that the matter is absolutely bolted down
               with the conditions that we have stated. Let me explain why it is important that we
               take part, because sometimes I read that it is simply a matter of politics in the EU.
               The truth is - this came home to me graphically during the Kosovo conflict - that
               European defence capability is not nearly as good as it needs to be. It has been a
               constant plea from the other side of the water - from the Americans themselves - that
               Europe has to develop better defence capability. I believe that it is important that
               we develop that in a way that is wholly consistent with NATO. If we had opted out of
               that debate altogether, that would still have happened. After all, a common defence
               policy was one of the matters agreed at Maastricht. That would still have happened,
               but not in a way that was consistent with our proper national interests. As a result
               of that, it is interesting - I say no more than that, and I am not suggesting that
               these policies are directly connected - that 11 out of 15 EU countries will this year
               increase their defence budgets for the first time in many years. If the proposal is
               implemented sensibly, it will work in this country's interests. Of course, there are
               risks, but it is precisely for that reason that we have spent the past two and a half
               years making sure that those risks do not materialise.</seg>

            <seg>For example, suppose that we were in the situation at the moment where we had
               unanimity rather than QMV for agricultural policy - in fact, because of what the
               Conservative party, which agreed to many, many items of QMV when it was in power,
               agreed, it is QMV for agricultural policy - that would be an area in which I would be
               saying that we need to move forward. We mentioned another a moment ago, in relation
               to the structural fund. Where is in this country's interest to unblock the veto of
               others. When people use the word "veto", one would think that only Britain had the
               ability to veto something. What the veto means is that something is decided by
               unanimity. If the European Union is extended from 15 to 20, 25, 27 or 30, it means
               that a country the size of, say, Estonia, Lithuania or Slovakia could block essential
               British national interests using the unanimity rule. It is not our veto; it is simply
               a consequence of the unanimity rule enjoyed by everyone. I think that the most
               sensible approach is to say, as the Conservative party used to when it was in office
               - or at least for several years of its time in office - that we judge it on a
               case-by-case basis. Such matters as defence, our border controls, tax, social
               security and treaty change must be agreed by unanimity. One of the statements that I
               made during our Council meeting was an explanation of why issues of taxation - the
               levels at which taxes are set - are, in my view, matters of fundamental national
               sovereignty, which must be dealt with by national Governments and national
               Parliaments. But there are other areas in which that is not the case. I think that we

               doing it now in Kosovo, in Bosnia and in many other parts of the world. All European
               defence does is give an additional string to our bow for limited operations -
               peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks - in which NATO does not want to become involved.
               Anyone who studies the history of Bosnia, particularly in the early 1990s, when the
               United States did not want to become involved, will find that Britain and France
               struggled in ad hoc co-operation to try to maintain the situation. Thousands of
               people died as a result. European defence is important as an additional string to our
               bow. I emphasise again that - whatever the French position on these issues may be -
               it is not a standing army and every decision on every mission will be the subject of
               a national, sovereign decision. Therefore, if we did not wish to participate - even
               if we were part of European defence - we would not have to participate. Although the

               the European Union comprises 27 members. I think that, in terms of the ratio of
               Members to population, the proportion is still relatively good. Therefore, although
               the cap has been extended, it has not been extended unduly. The common agricultural
               policy was discussed at Nice. However, that is a policy matter, and changing policy
               is the way in which it will be reformed. At Nice, we were primarily discussing treaty
               change. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman on his first point - that we want a
               Europe of nation states and not a federal superstate. I am wholly confident that that
               argument can be won. However, to win it, we have to engage in it.</seg>

               will talk to those who are engaged in working it out. There is no way in which the
               force will be a rival to NATO or act in circumstances other than those in which NATO
               chooses not to be involved. The reason for that is simple: many European Union
               countries are, like the United Kingdom, NATO members. As I said, in each individual
               decision, we will all have to choose to be involved. The force will operate only in
               the circumstances that I have just outlined. The idea that this will be an
               independent standing force set aside from NATO is nonsense. The right hon. and
               learned Gentleman asked whether it was better to develop our defence capability
               inside NATO. The whole purpose of the proposal is that it will allow us to do that
               inside NATO as well. That point has been made by our American allies, apart from
               people such as Richard Perle, who take a different point of view. <note>Hon. Members:
                  "Bill Cohen."</note> Bill Cohen did not take the opposite point of view. He said

               independent military planning capability and a rival to NATO, its establishment is in
               America's interest. Countries in the European Union may believe that it should be
               such a force; we do not. With our American allies and others in Europe who do not
               share that view, we shall ensure that we succeed. Over the next few months, the final

            <seg>No. Let me try to explain again. In circumstances where NATO decides that it does
               not want to be involved - perhaps an operation limited to the Petersberg tasks, where
               America decides that it does not want to be involved, for example, Bosnia in the
               early 1990s - then the European Union acts, but not with a military strategic
               capability outside NATO. That is absolutely clear from the documents that we have
               negotiated. For example, it was not an Under-Secretary from the 1980s, but the
               American Secretary of State who, just a few weeks ago, said: This EU force will be
               available to both NATO and the EU, in those cases where the Alliance as a whole is
               not militarily engaged. It offers a valuable complement to the efforts and
               capabilities of NATO. The only people who see that as a great threat to the NATO
               alliance are either those in the Conservative party or - in part as a result of
               things that those Conservatives have said and that others have written - those who
               are told that the force is a rival organisation to NATO. Anyone who has studied the
               matter realises that that is not the case. The point made by Chuck Hagel and others -
               as Bill Cohen was saying about a week ago - is that if there is the development of a
               rival, strategic military planning capability to NATO, then, yes, that would be a
