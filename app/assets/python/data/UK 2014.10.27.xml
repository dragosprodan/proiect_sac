         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>Yesterday British forces concluded their combat mission in Afghanistan. I know the
               thoughts of the whole House will be with the friends and families of every one of the
               453 British soldiers who lost their lives in this long campaign. We will never forget
               their sacrifice for us. When al-Qaeda attacked the twin towers in 2001, it planned
               that attack from Afghanistan, operating freely under the Taliban regime. Our
               incredible service - men and women have driven al-Qaeda out, and they have built up
               and trained the Afghan forces - none of which even existed in 2001 - so that the
               Afghans can take control of their own security. I said when I became Prime Minister
               that I would bring our combat troops home. Today they are coming home, and we should
               be incredibly proud of all that they have done to keep our country safe. With
               permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on last weeks European
               Council. Before turning to the issue of our contributions to the EU, let me first
               update the House on three significant agreements where the UK played an important
               role: on Ebola, on climate change and on the situation in Ukraine. First, on Ebola,
               the world is facing one of the worst public health emergencies in a generation.
               Playing our part in halting the rise of this terrible disease is not just meeting our
               moral obligations, but the single most effective way of preventing Ebola from
               infecting people in the United Kingdom. Britain has been making a major contribution
               to the international response, pledging more than 205 million and sending troops and
               health workers to west Africa, but Britain must also use its influence to get other
               countries to step up their contributions. Before the Council, I wrote to all my
               fellow leaders, urging that we significantly step up our collective response. At the
               meeting member states agreed to my proposal to more than double the EU effort by
               pledging over 1 billion in assistance. The Council also agreed to increase the
               deployment of medical and support staff in the region, and for member states to
               guarantee proper care for our courageous health workers. Secondly, it is vital that
               Europe plays its part if we are to secure a global deal on climate change in Paris
               next year. One problem we have faced in the past is that instead of just setting a
               binding target on carbon emissions, the EU has set binding national targets on things
               like renewables and energy efficiency. These diktats on how each country should reach
               its commitments can pile up costs on our industries, consumers and families who do
               not want to pay more on their energy bills than they have to, and they create an
               unnecessary trade-off between cutting carbon emissions and promoting economic growth.
               At this Council, we have chosen a different path. We have reached a landmark
               commitment to deliver at least 40% reductions in greenhouse gases by 2030, but we
               have rejected any new binding national targets for renewables or energy efficiency,
               giving us full flexibility over how we reduce our carbon, allowing us to do so at the
               lowest possible cost for businesses and consumers. This is another example of where
               British leadership has helped the EU to step up and meet its international
               obligations, while at the same time protecting our national interest by keeping
               energy bills down for businesses and Britains hard-working families. The Council also
               discussed the situation in Ukraine and relations with Russia. We welcomed the Minsk
               agreement between Kiev, Moscow and the separatists, but the Council was also clear
               that much more must be done to implement that agreement before the EU should consider
               lifting any of the sanctions put in place in response to the conflict and in response
               to Russias actions. The Council welcomed the parliamentary elections that took place
               in Ukraine yesterday, and it made it clear it would not recognise the outcome of any
               elections organised by the separatists outside the framework of Ukrainian law. Let me
               turn to the issue over the UKs contributions to the EU. I want to be clear with the
               House how the demand for the UK to repay money has come about, and why the scale and
               timing of this demand is unacceptable. Mr Speaker, in an organisation like the EU, if
               your economy grows a little faster or a little slower, then there can be adjustments
               every year to the amount that you pay. In some years, the UK adjustment has been
               negative - as it was in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012 - and in some years we contribute a
               little bit more. This happens every year. And when the UK is growing at 3% a year and
               many European economies are growing much more slowly, it would not be surprising to
               find Britain being asked to pay a little bit more this year. But what has never
               happened is for 2 billion to be demanded. This represents around 20% of our net
               contribution to the EU last year. Member states collectively are being asked to pay
               almost four times the highest gross figure requested in recent years. It is simply
               not acceptable for the EU to make these kinds of demands, and to do so through a
               fast-tracked process lasting barely a month. 2 billion is bigger than many countries
               entire gross contributions; it cannot just be nodded through by the EU bureaucracy as
               some kind of technical adjustment. It is British taxpayers money, and it is not small
               change, but it is a vast sum. So this has to be examined in detail and discussed
               properly. That is why I interrupted the Council meeting on Friday to seek an urgent
               resolution to this issue. I was supported by the Prime Ministers of Italy, Holland,
               Malta, Greece and others, and the Council agreed that there would be an urgent
               discussion with Finance Ministers to resolve the issue going forwards. The issue is
               not just the scale of the money being demanded, but the timetable. The Commission
               admits that it does not actually need this - indeed, the President of the Commission
               was not even aware of it on Thursday evening - so there is no pressing need for the
               money to be paid. There are fundamental questions over the fairness of these
               payments. For example, the proposal is for funds to be taken from the UK to correct
               historic contributions to the EU budget dating back to 2002, and to be redistributed
               based on the current share of gross national income to countries which only joined
               the EU in 2004 and 2007. But it is not just that Britain would lose out. It is also
               perverse that a country like Greece - at the heart of the crisis in the eurozone - is
               being asked to find money to pay back to countries like Germany. The revised gross
               national income statistics on which these adjustments are based are also not yet
               finalised. The numbers are a "provisional estimate" and the EU-wide process to
               quality-assure the figures will not conclude until well into 2015. Britain will not
               be paying 2 billion to anyone on 1 December, and we reject this scale of payment. We
               will be challenging this in every way possible. We want to check how the statistics
               were arrived at and the methodology that was used; we will crawl through this in
               exhaustive detail. The events at last weeks Council will not - to use some British
               understatement - have enhanced the reputation of the European Union in the United
               Kingdom. As the Italian Prime Minister put it, even the EUs founding fathers would
               turn to Euroscepticism when faced with some of the things that you have seen here.
               The European Union has to change. It has to regain trust, and that starts by
               understanding and respecting the fact that these payments and adjustments are about
               the hard-earned taxes of its citizens. This is just one of the many challenges in our
               long campaign to reform the European Union, but it is vital we stick to the task. We
               have already cut the EU budget, got Britain out of the bail-out schemes, vetoed a
               treaty that was not in our national interest, made vital progress on cutting red tape
               and completing the single market, and we are leading the push for what will be the
               biggest bilateral trade deal in history, between the EU and the US. None of this is
               easy. Progress is hard-won. It requires perseverance and hard work. We will carry on
               defending our national interest and fighting with all we have to reform the EU over
               the coming years. At the end of 2017, it will not be the Brussels bureaucracy or the
               politicians of any party who will decide whether we remain in the EU. If I am Prime
               Minister, it will be the British people who make that decision through an in/out
               referendum. Others who aspire to this office and who refuse to give the British
               people their say, should explain themselves to the House and the country, and I
               commend this statement to the House.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#MILIBAND-EDWARD">
            <seg>I thank the Prime Minister for his statement. Let me start by echoing his words
               about the contribution of our armed forces in Afghanistan. All our thanks are with
               those who have served our country, and all our thoughts are with the families of
               those who lost their lives. We will continue to support the Afghan Government through
               political and humanitarian aid, as well as our training mission. Every one of our
               troops who served in Afghanistan can take pride in their mission and what they
               achieved, and the House and the whole country are proud of them. I also echo the
               Prime Ministers words about Ukraine and support for its Government. On climate
               change, I welcome the climate and energy package, paving the way for the global UN
               summit in Paris next year. What action will he be taking in the coming months to
               encourage other countries, especially China and the United States, to bring forward
               ambitious targets and policies in advance of that conference? Turning to the Ebola
               crisis in west Africa, the whole world has been horrified by the devastating scenes.
               Our hearts go out to the communities that confront the threat on a daily basis. I
               welcome the Government's efforts to help affected countries. We are proud of the work
               of our armed forces, our health professionals and our aid community. What effort was
               made at the summit to encourage other countries to do what Britain has done by
               sending health workers and personnel to the affected region? Let me turn to the EU
               budget change. The Commissions handling of the matter has been cack-handed and
               unacceptable, and it has caused consternation in several other states. The urgent
               priority now is for the Government to pursue all diplomatic means to get the best
               deal for Britain, but the Prime Minister must also explain whether the Government
               carried out due diligence in their handling of the matter. He says that he was made
               aware of the matter only on 23 October, while the Chancellor said that he had no
               warning, but that is simply not the case. The budget changes arise due to changed
               estimates of gross national income - GNI. The scale of the changes should not have
               taken anyone in government by surprise because extensive coverage was given to
               significant changes to our national income arising from the inclusion of the shadow
               economy, which is worth more than 50 billion. Will the Prime Minister confirm that
               the Office for National Statistics agreed to, and has been part of, these substantial
               and planned changes throughout Europe for at least two years - since 2012?</seg>
            <seg>Will he further confirm that the ONS stated publicly in May 2014 that the changes
               would impact our budget contribution? It said in a press release that GNI <quote>is
                  used in the calculation of a Member States contribution to the EU budget.</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>The Treasury was clearly aware of the situation, because I have here a letter that
               the then Economic Secretary, the right hon. Member for Loughborough</seg>
            <note>Nicky Morgan</note>
            <seg>, wrote to a parliamentary Committee on Europe not seven days ago, but seven months
               agoon 11 March 2014. She said in that very interesting letter that changes to GNI
               would take place in time for 2014 and wrote about the high priority that the
               Government were giving to addressing them. The changes had been planned for a number
               of years, the ONS publicly declared that they would have an impact on our budget
               contribution, and Ministers knew about them and claimed that they were a high
               priority, so when the Prime Minister replies, will he really maintain that there was
               no warning and that Treasury Ministers knew nothing about the changes? Surely the
               Treasury must have made its own assessment of the impact on the EU budget that would
               follow. As a matter of basic competence, if it did not do that, why not? This matters
               because the Prime Minister could have done much earlier what he did at the last
               minute on Friday: called for a meeting of Finance Ministers and entered negotiations
               about the demand. Is not the truth that this is a familiar pattern with this Prime
               Minister: months and months when he does not do the work, followed by last-minute
               pyrotechnics when it goes wrong? No one will be fooled by it. He spends all his time
               negotiating with his party about Europe, when what he should be doing is the basic
               work of getting a better deal for Britain. Once again he shows that, for all his
               bluster, he has been asleep at the wheel and the British people are paying the
               price.</seg>

               piece of paper in front of your mouth does not hide the fact that it is you. Calm
               yourself, man. Let us hear from the Prime Minister.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>It is very noisy today, Mr Speaker - a bit like a meeting of the Scottish Labour
               party. Let me answer all the right hon. Gentleman’s questions. On climate change, he
               asked specifically what we would now do to push China and America to make bigger
               concessions. I think that the European Union now has the opportunity to give a real
               lead, because we have set out the major steps that we are prepared to take, with a
               reduction of at least 40% in carbon emissions. On Ebola, the right hon. Gentleman is
               absolutely right that we need not only money from other European countries - we got
               that at the weekend - but the commitment that they will help their health staff to
               travel to west Africa. There is now a clearing house for medevac arrangements,
               negotiated by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, which I think will make a
               real difference. On Afghanistan, I welcome the support that the right hon. Gentleman
               has given. I think that it is good that there is cross-party support for the backing
               that the Afghan Government should know they will get from Britain in terms of aid and
               paying for the Afghan national security forces. On the budget, let me say this to the
               right hon. Gentleman: the point is that we cannot know how much we are liable to pay
               until the European Commission produces the figures for every country in Europe. That
               information was not available weeks ago or months ago; it was discussed at a meeting
               in Brussels only on Friday. That is why Labour left the country in such a mess: they
               do not know the difference between gross contributions and net contributions. That is
               the problem. Basically, the right hon. Gentleman’s case comes down to two complaints.
               The first is that somehow we are giving too much money to Brussels. That is from a
               party that gave away the British rebate and paid an extra 2 billion a year as a
               matter of official Government policy. The second complaint - we heard it from the
               shadow Chancellor - is that somehow under this Government the Chancellor and the
               Prime Minister do not properly communicate with each other. I have to say that we see
               in front of us the authors of the most dysfunctional Government in British history.
               The Prime Minister in that Government did not even know what was in the Budget the
               day before it was brought to the House of Commons. The idea that they should lecture
               us on how a Government communicate must be one of the most ridiculous ever brought
               before the House. With the shambles in the Scottish Labour party, we learnt one thing
               this weekend: even his own party does not see him as a leader.</seg>

               important to understand that these are provisional estimates and that EUROSTAT is
