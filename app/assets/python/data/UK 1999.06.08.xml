   <text>
      <body>
         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg> With your permission, Madam Speaker, I should like to make a statement on two
               subjects: Kosovo and the European Council in Cologne which I attended on 3 and 4
               June, accompanied by my right hon. Friends the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor
               of the Exchequer. The conclusions of the Council are being placed in the Library of
               the House.</seg>
            <seg>A large part of the European Council was taken up with the crisis in Kosovo.
               President Ahtisaari came straight from his mission to Belgrade to brief the Council.
               The peace plan that President Ahtisaari and the Russian special envoy, Mr.
               Chernomyrdin, presented to Milosevic was accepted by the Serb Parliament and the
               Federal Yugoslav Government on 3 June. The plan incorporated all NATO's demands. It
               provided for the immediate and verifiable end to violence in Kosovo; the withdrawal
               of all military, police and paramilitary forces according to a rapid timetable; the
               deployment of an effective international security presence and a civil administration
               - the document specified that, in any such force, the substantial participation would
               be that of NATO, and that there would be a unified command and control - and for the
               force to be authorised to establish a safe environment for the people in Kosovo and
               to facilitate the safe return of all displaced people and refugees.</seg>
            <seg>So the document presented by President Ahtisaari embodied all the conditions set by
               the international community: all Serb forces come out; an international force with
               NATO at its core goes in; and the refugees go home in safety and peace. However, we
               did not - and do not - take Milosevic's assurance on trust. The Balkans are littered
               with his broken promises. That is why NATO has insisted all along that the bombing
               will not stop until a full and verifiable withdrawal of all Serb forces from Kosovo
               has begun.</seg>
            <seg>To give us the certainty we need about Serb withdrawal, the commander of NATO's
               forces in Macedonia, General Sir Mike Jackson, met representatives of the Federal
               Yugoslav military on the border at Blace on 5 and 6 June. Those talks ended early on
               7 June after the Yugoslav side repeatedly failed to accept the document put forward
               by NATO. Instead they tried, among other things, to insist on large numbers of Serb
               troops remaining. That was and is unacceptable.</seg>
            <seg>However, this morning, the Foreign Secretary and his colleagues from the G8 group
               of countries completed their work on the text of a Security Council resolution. I can
               confirm to the House that agreement has now been reached in the G8 on a text that
               enshrines the Ahtisaari-Chernomyrdin plan and its detailed terms.</seg>
            <seg>The text is strong and clear and meets our requirements. It will now go forward to
               the Security Council. It comes under chapter VII of the United Nations charter, which
               means that the resolution will be legally binding on the Federal Republic of
               Yugoslavia, and it authorises, through its detailed provisions, the use of force to
               ensure its implementation. It requires, in particular, the withdrawal of all Serb
               forces from Kosovo, and authorises the deployment of our forces as part of a
               substantial NATO component in the international security presence, which will have a
               unified chain of command. The members of the G8 that are also on the Security Council
               - the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Canada - have agreed that they will
               co-sponsor the draft.</seg>
            <seg>If we need any reminder of the regime that we are dealing with, let me give the
               House one account, delivered by a refugee when the United Kingdom Government's war
               crimes co-ordinator, David Gowan, visited Albanian and Macedonian refugee camps last
               week.</seg>
            <seg>A professional in his late 30s or early 40s said that he was one of more than 2,000
               men picked up by Serb forces in early May in villages south of Pristina. They were
               separated from their families, beaten and transferred to the prison at Mittrovica.
               The prisoners were forced into cells and made to stand, shoulder to shoulder, for 24
               hours without food, water or access to a lavatory. They were then beaten again,
               systematically, in the prison.</seg>
            <seg>Yet that refugee still said that he was among the lucky ones. He had witnessed
               himself summary executions when he was detained at the village of Vushtria, and had
               heard reports of a mass execution of 103 men in the nearby village of Studime. So
               when the refugees say that they want to be sure that the Serb troops will go out, and
               that our troops will go in to guarantee their safety, it is not hard to understand
               why.</seg>
            <seg>The next step, therefore, will be further military talks to put in place the
               necessary technical agreement. They are taking place today at Blace. Given the
               progress on a Security Council resolution, there is no excuse for the Yugoslav
               authorities to drag their feet again. Provided that the Serbs now, at long last,
               honour their undertakings and begin a verifiable withdrawal of their forces, NATO
               bombing can be suspended and the Security Council resolution passed, and the
               international force can start to be deployed in Kosovo before the end of this
               week.</seg>
            <seg>It is time, however, that Milosevic realised that the longer he tries to draw this
               out, the longer and harder his forces will be hit. We have achieved this agreement
               only by showing total resolve and determination; we shall need to be as resolved and
               as determined now in implementing it. We are close to having all the elements in
               place, but until we are certain that Milosevic has embarked on the withdrawal of all
               his forces, NATO's military action will continue.</seg>
            <seg>We can also now start planning in earnest for the reconstruction of the Balkans to
               give the peoples of the region the security and prosperity that they need to avoid
               future wars. The future of these front-line states, many of which I have visited in
               the past few weeks, should be one of peace and prosperity, not ethnic conflict. The
               people of a democratic Serbia can also benefit from reconstruction and integration
               into the mainstream of Europe, but let me be clear: that cannot happen while there is
               a nationalist dictator in power in Belgrade. Until Milosevic goes, Serbia cannot take
               its true place in the family of world nations.</seg>
            <seg>Events in Kosovo overshadowed other issues at the European Council, but other
               important work was done too. The European Council appointed Javier Solana to the new
               post of Secretary-General of the Council and High Representative for the common
               foreign and security policy. Mr. Solana is a friend of Britain, and a highly capable
               operator, as we have seen during the Kosovo crisis. His new appointment will boost
               the effectiveness and credibility of the common foreign and security policy, and I
               warmly welcome it.</seg>
            <seg>There was a full discussion of economic policy.The European Council unanimously
               reaffirmed that sustainable, non-inflationary growth and increased employment
               required comprehensive structural reforms at European Union and national levels. The
               message is clear in the broad economic guidelines, which the European Council
               approved, and in the new European employment pact.</seg>
            <seg>As for the future development of the Union, the European Council took a number of
               important steps. It heard a strong statement from the President elect of the
               Commission about his plans for reform of that institution, and the Council pledged
               its full support for Mr. Prodi's approach to reform. The Council welcomed the new
               European anti-fraud office, whose establishment was agreed at the ECOFIN Council on
               25 May, and which will permit the Union to step up the fight against fraud,
               corruption and mismanagement. Agreement was reached on the further development of a
               common European security and defence policy, building on the ideas that we outlined
               last year, which were warmly endorsed by NATO at its Washington summit in
               April.</seg>
            <seg>The European Council confirmed that an intergovernmental conference would be called
               early next year to resolve the issues that were left open at the Amsterdam European
               Council, which need to be settled before enlargement. The Council also endorsed an
               initiative by Prime Minister Guterres of Portugal to convene next March, under the
               Portuguese presidency, a special meeting of the European Council, which will be
               entirely devoted to economic reform and employment. The initiative is very welcome,
               and follows the call for such an event at the Anglo-Spanish summit on 10 April. We
               are making real headway in promoting economic reform in Europe, which - as I have
               repeatedly said in this House - is essential to ensure sustained growth and the
               unqualified success of the single currency.</seg>
            <seg>The Council rejected the notion of ending tax competition or of the harmonisation
               of business and income taxes. Instead, the Council decided, sensibly, that merely
               harmful tax competition should be avoided; and it actually advocated lower business
               and labour costs. Unfortunately, although we had the support of 13 of the 14 other
               member states, we could not reverse the duty free decision taken in 1991 by the
               previous Government, as they had agreed to its being reversible only if there were
               unanimity.</seg>
            <seg>At the Council as a whole, therefore, substantial progress was made on economic
               reform, but, as I said at the outset, it was rightly and understandably dominated by
               Kosovo. Let us hope that the process begun at this Council and taken forward today at
               the G8 will come swiftly to a secure and just conclusion, ending the obscenity of
               ethnic cleansing and obtaining justice at last for the people of Kosovo.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#HAGUE">
            <seg>I concur with the Prime Minister that the outline agreement on Kosovo reached last
               week is very encouraging, as indeed is some of the further news that he has announced
               about today's agreement of the G8, and that we must now ensure, through all the
               difficulties that are bound to arise, that those agreements are implemented in
               full.</seg>
            <seg>We agree with the Prime Minister that the air campaign must not stop until there is
               a verifiable withdrawal of Serb forces. On that, the Government have the support of
               the Opposition, as they do on the announcement of the additional deployment of
               British troops to the region.</seg>
            <seg>The key test of any agreement is whether all the refugees can return in safety to
               their homes. That raises a number of questions. First, does the Prime Minister agree
               that the ground force will have to be effectively NATO led, and that the unified
               command structure to which he has referred will have to run throughout the whole of
               Kosovo, to avoid any de facto partition of Kosovo? Will the United Nations resolution
               achieve that?</seg>
            <seg>Secondly, is the Prime Minister confident that the Kosovo Liberation Army will
               demilitarise as set out in the agreement? What exactly does demilitarisation mean in
               that context, and how will it be achieved?</seg>
            <seg>Thirdly, the Rambouillet accords provided for an international meeting, three years
               after the agreement entered force, to determine the mechanism for a final settlement
               based at least partly on the will of the people. The provision was excluded from last
               week's outline agreement. In what way will the views of the Kosovar Albanians be
               reflected in the determination of the final status of Kosovo?</seg>
            <seg>Both sides of the House agree that there is still an enormous amount to do. We must
               oversee the refugees' return, and of course we must ensure that the events in Kosovo
               are not repeated there or elsewhere. Will the Prime Minister elaborate on plans to
               bring greater stability and peace to the region in the longer term, so that people
               may enjoy, as he has said, peace and prosperity, instead of ethnic conflict, in the
               future?</seg>
            <seg>Kosovo was the most pressing issue at Cologne, but many other decisions taken there
               were important to Britain. Why did the Prime Minister not make the case for the type
               of Europe that the British public want - a Europe that does less and does it better,
               and that cleans up its act? When will he stop saying one thing in Britain, and then
               caving in during negotiations?</seg>
            <seg>Two years ago, the Prime Minister vetoed a proposal on European defence on the
               grounds that it would weaken the United States's commitment to Europe, and that it
               was an "ill-judged transplant operation". Why has he now supported a proposal that is
               effectively the same? Is it not a mistake to create a second defence alliance in
               Europe, which will overlap with NATO and threaten to undermine the United States
               commitment to NATO? What is the EU doing proposing an army when it cannot even run an
               audit system properly?</seg>
            <seg>The Prime Minister has always claimed - he claimed it again today - that he will
               resist tax harmonisation. However, the communique says that <quote>"good progress has
                  been made" on proposals "on the taxation of investment income"; that agreement on
                  "proposals for a Directive on the taxation of savings" will be reached this year;
                  that work on "a framework for the taxation of energy" will continue; and that a
                  further report on "reinforced tax policy co-operation" is being prepared.</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>Why did the Prime Minister agree in Cologne to the most comprehensive plan yet for
               tax harmonisation? Why, when people in this country want to maintain the veto, did he
               agree to a communique that calls for the extension of qualified majority voting - in
               other words, a further erosion of the veto?</seg>
            <seg>Finally, can the Prime Minister explain the lamentable summit shenanigans over the
               single currency? The Prime Minister of Luxembourg said memorably that the
                  <quote>"moment for unfettered panic has not arrived"</quote>.</seg>
            <seg>Instead, the summit opted for a spot of carefully controlled panic. Statements were
               issued and then withdrawn. As The Times said: <quote>"European leaders... bungled an
                  attempt to bolster the ailing euro", spreading "confusion through the foreign
                  exchanges, sending the euro tumbling towards fresh record lows"</quote>.</seg>
            <seg>We read that, from now on, only two people in Europe will be allowed to speak about
               the single currency - judging from the Prime Minister's European election campaign,
               he is not privileged to be one of them.</seg>
            <seg>Is it not time that the Government's position at such meetings reflected the views
               of the people of this country? Is it not time that the Government's priority was to
               act in the interests of Britain, rather than seeking at every opportunity to go with
               the flow in Europe? Does the Prime Minister not recognise that most people in this
               country do not want any more powers transferred from Britain to European
               institutions? They want their taxes decided in this House, and oppose his plans to
               scrap the pound. They want to be in Europe, not run by Europe.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>First, I shall deal with what the right hon. Gentleman said about Kosovo. I thank
               him for his support. The force must have a NATO core and a unified chain of command.
               That is clear. There must be no question of a de facto partition of Kosovo.</seg>
            <seg>On the future of the Kosovar Albanians, the Rambouillet accords are specifically
               mentioned in the resolution. There will have to be discussions about the right future
               for Kosovo, but in the meantime there will be a civil administration that is
               internationally guaranteed, and there will be substantial autonomy for the people of
               Kosovo. I cannot see them having any confidence in rule from Serbia while Milosevic
               remains in power. That is very clear.</seg>
            <seg>In the longer term, it is essential that we begin work as soon as possible on a
               regeneration programme for the Balkans, because many of the front-line states - such
               as Bulgaria, Romania, Macedonia and Albania - have given us support in circumstances
               of intense internal difficulty. Theirs has been a far more difficult path than that
               of countries such as ours. It is essential that they should be given their reward for
               that. We must show them that there is a different path for the future. In some of
               those front-line states, there are forces that would be happy for their politics to
               be dominated by ethnic conflict. We have to show that the values of democracy pay
               off. When we consider how much the international community has spent over the past 10
               years on resolving conflict in the Balkans, it is at least worth thinking about how
               we can make some prudent investment in ensuring that we never have to go and sort out
               further conflicts. It is important to begin work on that as soon as possible.</seg>
            <seg>On Europe, the right hon. Gentleman did not accurately set out the terms of the
               agreements that we have entered into. He asked why the agreement on defence is
               different from that proposed at Amsterdam. The reason is simple: at Amsterdam we were
               asked to agree to something that would have clashed with NATO. As a result of getting
               involved, we have ensured that Europe's common defence policy is expressed in terms
               completely consistent with membership of NATO.</seg>
            <seg>As for qualified majority voting and the veto, we have said that we take a
               case-by-case view. In some circumstances, qualified majority voting might have been
               in Britain's interests - I mentioned the example of duty free. The difference between
               the Conservative party as it used to be and the Conservative party as the right hon.
               Gentleman has made it is shown by the fact that the biggest extension of qualified
               majority voting was agreed by the Conservative Government as part of the passage of
               the Single European Act. It was right that they did that. They did it not because
               they were betraying the national interest, but because it was in the interest of this
               country to develop a single market in Europe. That is the choice for this country.
               Over the past few weeks, the right hon. Gentleman has defined the modern Conservative
               party by its hostility to Europe.</seg>
            <seg>At the very beginning of his questions, the right hon. Gentleman asked me why I did
               not go to the European Council and argue the points that he made in his Budapest
               speech a few weeks ago. In his first question, he asked me for what is effectively a
               renegotiation of the treaty of Rome and Britain's entry into the European
               Union.</seg>
            <incident>
               <desc>Interruption</desc>
            </incident>
            <seg>They are nodding away; let us test them. Such a renegotiation requires the consent
               of the other 14 members of the European Union. Can they name one that supports that
               proposition?</seg>
            <seg>If the right hon. Gentleman had been in my position, he would have gone to the
               European Council seeking a renegotiation of Britain's terms of entry into the
               European Union, and not a single other European country would have supported him. The
               Conservatives would return this country to precisely that position. We would be
               without influence, power or any authority in Europe. That is not all, however. They
               want to cancel the changeover plan for the single currency so that even if we wanted
               to join, we would be unable to do so, and they would cancel the defence initiative
               that we have undertaken, even though NATO has now endorsed it. It is also true that
               many Conservative candidates in the European Parliament will not even join the
               European Conservative parties.</seg>
            <seg>That is a recipe for complete disaster for this country. There are short-term
               tactical reasons for going for it, but it is a big, long-term strategic mistake, and
               the choice for this country on Thursday is leading in Europe or leaving it.</seg>

            <seg>It now looks as if Kosovo will be seen as a famous victory for international order
               and justice, but one thing is clear from the conflict: the reputation of my right
               hon. Friend the Prime Minister and the United Kingdom has been mightily enhanced by
               the clear leadership that he and other Ministers have given. How does my right hon.
               Friend propose to reach beyond the Milosevic Government and get the message clearly
               to the people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that they have no future under
               Milosevic and that they must have a leader who is capable of mending fences with the
               west? How can he ensure that war crime investigators enter Kosovo speedily to ensure
               that the evidence of war crimes is not destroyed by the barbarians?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>I thank my hon. Friend for his kind words. I have two things to say. First, it is
               important, perhaps particularly now, that we do not regard the conflict as having
               been won in any sense until the refugees go back and are safe. Some people asked why
               we were less than euphoric last Friday. I will allow myself to feel relieved when it
               actually happens. We have to watch Milosevic and his games and tricks every single
               inch of the way. He must be under no illusion whatever that if he starts them up
               again, our force remains there. He should realise that, and it should give him the
               incentive that he needs to make sure that this is concluded properly.</seg>
            <seg>I am pleased that the draft resolution makes specific mention of the jurisdiction
               of the war crimes tribunal. My hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that we have to
               reach out to democratic forces in Serbia. I know that many people in Serbia bitterly
               opposed the NATO campaign, even those who are also opposed to Milosevic. However,
               they must now understand that he has been obliged to accept terms that he could have
               accepted 10 weeks ago. He has devastated their country, ruined its economy and made
               it an outcast from the world of nations. It is a proud nation which, in many ways,
               has a history of which its people can be proud. If they want to regain their place in
               the community of nations, Milosevic's going is the best way of achieving that.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#ASHDOWN">
            <seg>Is it not true that it is not over until it is over on the ground in Kosovo? Until
               that happens, we must judge President Milosevic not by his words, but by his actions.
               That means that we must keep up the military pressure - the only language that he
               understands - and the pressure from the air. Does the Prime Minister agree that that
               means also continuing to make those preparations that NATO has made more recently for
               the use of ground troops, if necessary? Despite that, the events of the last week
               ought to give NATO, the Government and the Prime Minister personally good cause for
               satisfaction as they are a vindication of the policy that they and he have
               followed.</seg>
            <seg>Is not the last-minute wrangling and wriggling by Milosevic an attempt to evade
               three unshakeable principles: first, that all Serb authority must be removed from
               Kosovo; secondly, that there must be an international force with teeth and with NATO
               at its core, backed by a Security Council resolution; and thirdly, that the refugees
               must return in peace, live in freedom and have a future in security?</seg>
            <seg>In the Balkans, the devil lies in the detail, and there are four brief questions
               that I wish to ask by way of clarification. First, will the Prime Minister confirm
               that the interim status of Kosovo will be, de facto if not de jure, as an
               international protectorate or trusteeship? Will he tell us who the sponsor of that
               will be? Will it be the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and
               Co-operation in Europe or the European Union?</seg>
            <seg>Secondly, will the Prime Minister confirm that just as Rambouillet did not exclude
               self-determination in the long term, nothing in the present agreement excludes it?
               The agreement may not include it, but it should not exclude it.</seg>
            <seg>Thirdly, does the Prime Minister agree that we must not repeat the mistake made in
               Bosnia of putting the civil administration in too late? It should go in as early as
               possible.</seg>
            <seg>Lastly, will the Prime Minister refer back to his own statement, in which he
               mentioned the experience of the refugees? They will not go back if they see Serb
               troops. However, small numbers of Serb troops - lightly armed, or maybe unarmed - may
               be on the borders. Will he reflect on what the refugees will think if they see Serb
               troops on the borders? Will he consider this as a proposition: that every detachment
               of Serb troops anywhere in Kosovo should be matched by a detachment of NATO troops
               who will be there to reassure the refugees and, if necessary, afford them
               protection?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>We cannot take anything for granted until the killing stops on the ground in
               Kosovo. Until the Serb forces are fully withdrawn, all options remain open. The basic
               principles are that Milosevic's forces go out, the international force goes in and
               the refugees go back - that is the simple mantra by which we must be guided.</seg>
            <seg>On the right hon. Gentleman's detailed questions, the interim status of Kosovo is
               as an international civil administration, so it is guaranteed by the entire
               international community in that sense. We must establish it provisionally, and then
               put in place the proper democratic mechanisms. Secondly, nothing is excluded in the
               long term. Thirdly, I agree that the civil administration should go in and get to
               work as soon as possible. Fourthly, it is important to remember that certain Serb
               troops may go back in to do certain tasks that need to be done, but they are not
               going back in to be the guardians of the people in Kosovo. Those envisaged as going
               back in under the Ahtisaari agreement are fewer in number than those envisaged at
               Rambouillet.</seg>

               that tore up the UN charter in quite the way that my right hon. Friend and his

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>The terms of the Security Council resolution are circulating now. I do not know
               what proper arrangements I should make for its being made available, but whatever I
               am able to do I will do. Obviously, we want the resolution to be passed as soon as
               possible. The Russian position on the resolution and the bombing has always been
               clear, but so has our position: that we must be sure of the verifiable withdrawal of
               Milosevic's troops before the bombing can be stopped.</seg>
            <seg>On the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the current
               proposition is precisely what was available at Rambouillet and could have been
               accepted 10 weeks ago. The KLA's agreeing to disarm was also in the Rambouillet
               agreement. From discussions that I have had with KLA people, I believe that they will
               abide by what the international community has decreed, but they will of course also
               want to know that the Serb troops really are out of Kosovo. That is hardly
               surprising.</seg>
            <seg>No, the removal of Milosevic is not required. We have made it clear that that is
               not a war aim, but I have also made it clear - and I am sure that this will be the
               position of the international community - that Serbia cannot be part of international
               reconstruction and regeneration until he goes and there is a democratic Serbia,
               because otherwise, for one thing, any money that went in there would simply add to
               his very large personal wealth rather than going to his people.</seg>
            <seg>The solution was not available weeks ago. If my right hon. Friend is saying that if
               only we had picked up the phone and called the Russians and the Chinese everyone
               would have come together and made an agreement and we would not have needed to do all
               this, I really must ask him to reflect on that and on the lessons of what has
               happened. We tried for months and months. There were 72 UN resolutions against
               Milosevic. He will not accept any resolution from anyone unless he knows that the
               alternative is force. I am afraid to say that that is obvious to most reasonable
               people at the conclusion of these events.</seg>
            <seg>My right hon. Friend is entirely entitled to take the view that he does, but the
               choice was either to allow ethnic cleansing to continue unchecked or to do our best
               to stop it. I do not feel any sense of triumph at what we have achieved, because I
               know how many people have died and how many lives have been made miserable, but I
               honestly believe that if we had allowed ethnic cleansing to continue unchecked the
               consequences would have been far more devastating for people in Kosovo, for Balkan
               stability, for the world as a whole and the values of civilisation.</seg>

               capability. One reason for our desire to engage in the debate about a common defence
               policy is that it had been intended that Europe would have a common defence and
               security policy in any event. We faced a choice between engaging with that debate and
               shaping it in a way that was fully consistent with NATO, and opting out once again. I
               am afraid that the latter option is the view of those on the Opposition Front
               Bench.</seg>
            <seg>I think that opting out would be foolish, but I agree that the debate does imply
               changes of policy in member states. There is no question of abolishing the British
               Army in favour of a European army. That has always been an absurd scare. However, if
               Europe is to develop a proper and serious defence capability, we must examine the
               strategic capability of European defence and the European defence industry to see
               what changes are necessary. Kosovo has brought that lesson home to us in a very stark

            <seg>I would not pay too much attention to some of the allegations that have been made
               about environmental damage before evaluating them properly. For example, after
               investigation by wholly independent people from the UN, some of the allegations made
               about such damage were found to be false. I do not know the answer to the question of
               what environmental damage there is, but I suspect that there is a good deal less than
               some of the people who have been supporting Serbia would accept.</seg>
            <seg>What we are saying is clear and straightforward: we cannot put international money
               into financing the reconstruction of Serbia while Milosevic remains in power. People
               would not understand it if we did so. It is important to give a democratic Serbia the
               prospect of being able to be part of Balkan reconstruction if it embraces the values
               of democracy.</seg>

            <seg> We are not at the stage of discussing what exchange rate the pound and the euro
               should have, if we enter the euro. I believe that our policy is sensible. The hon.
               Gentleman's policy would effectively rule out the euro and cancel the changeover
               plan, which would mean that we could not join the euro even if we wanted to. That is
               not a sensible policy. If I were him - one of the younger, aspiring Members on the
               Conservative Back Benches - I would think about where he wants his party to be in a
               few years' time, rather than joining in -</seg>
