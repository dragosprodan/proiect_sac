         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>With permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a statement on last weeks European
               Council. The European Union faces important choices in the coming months in order to
               meet tough economic challenges and deal with problems in the eurozone. There were no
               landmark decisions at this Council, but there was some limited progress on both
               issues. As I have said, we are in a global economic race, and all European economies
               need to become more competitive. That means taking steps such as expanding their
               private sectors, reforming welfare and improving education. In terms of action at
               European Union level, we believe that it means lifting the burdens on businesses,
               completing the single market, and taking forward trade deals with the biggest
               economies and the fastest-growing countries and regions in the world. I have
               consistently promoted those solutions, and at the Council we made some progress. On
               deregulation, I joined others to secure a new agreement that specifically refers to
               withdrawing legislative proposals from Brussels that stifle our businesses. Of
               course, we now need to see specific actions, but it is worth noting that the
               conclusions refer to the <quote>"intention to withdraw a number of pending proposals
                  and to identify possible areas where the regulatory burden could be
                  lightened".</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>On completion of the single market, as I reported in June, there is now a proper
               plan with dates and actions for completing the market in energy, services and
               digital, but once again it is important for that to be followed through in order to
               secure jobs and growth. On trade, the Council agreed on an ambitious agenda to create
               2 million jobs across Europe. That includes completing free trade deals with Canada
               and Singapore in the coming months, and starting negotiations with the United States
               next year on a comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment agreement. We made
               some new progress on launching negotiations with Japan "in the coming months". That
               deal alone could increase European Union GDP by 42 billion.</seg>
            <seg>Let me now turn to the eurozone. Britain is not in the eurozone and we will not be
               joining the eurozone, but it is in our national interest for the uncertainty
               surrounding the eurozone to end. I have argued for some time that a working eurozone
               needs a working banking union. It is one of the features that a successful single
               currency needs. Obviously you do not need a banking union because you have a single
               market; you need it because you have a single currency - so Britain should not, and
               will not, be part of that banking union.</seg>
            <seg>Britains banks will be supervised by the Bank of England, not by the European
               Central Bank, and British taxpayers will not be guaranteeing or rescuing eurozone
               banks, but we do need eurozone members to get on with forming a banking union. At the
               Council, I joined those who were arguing for progress to be made on the plan that had
               been announced in June. To put it simply, I believe that it is not enough to have a
               banking union that is stripped of the very elementssuch as mutualised deposit
               guarantees, a common fiscal backstop and a framework for rescuing banks - that are
               needed to break the dangerous link in the eurozone between sovereign debt problems
               and the stability of eurozone banks. But because not all countries outside the
               eurozone - like Britain - will want to join such a banking union, it is also
               essential that the unity and integrity of the single market is fully respected. The
               organisation that currently ensures a level playing field for banking within the
               single market is the European Banking Authority. We need to make sure that it will
               continue to function properly, ensuring fair and effective decision making. This,
               again, is specifically recognised in the conclusions. More broadly, as eurozone
               countries take steps to deepen their economic and monetary union - as they will - it
               is important that we secure, as I did, an explicit commitment in the conclusions that
               the final report and road map in December will include concrete proposals to ensure
               that the integrity of the single market is respected.</seg>
            <seg>Finally, the next Council in November will discuss the financial framework for
               Europe between 2014 and 2020. We have not put in place tough settlements in Britain
               in order to go to Brussels and sign up to big increases in European spending. I do
               not believe that German voters want that any more than British voters, and that is
               why our Governments have led the argument in Europe for fiscal restraint, so I put
               down a marker that we need a rigorous settlement. As the letter signed in December
               2010 by a number of European leaders said, given the tough spending settlements that
               all member states have had to pursue in their own countries, <quote>"payment
                  appropriations should increase, at most, by no more than inflation over the next
                  financial perspectives".</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>On foreign affairs, the Council, led by Britain, once again discussed further
               restrictive measures on the Syrian regime, and made clear to Iran that we will
               increase the pressure if there is no progress on the nuclear dossier. Making our
               economies competitive, dealing with uncertainty in the eurozone, keeping the EU
               budget under proper control, and making sure the EU speaks with a strong and united
               voice on the key international challenges: this is our agenda, and I commend this
               statement to the House.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#MILIBAND-EDWARD">
            <seg>I thank the Prime Minister for his statement and associate myself entirely with the
               summits conclusions in particular on Iran and Syria. The dangers of the civil war in
               Syria spilling over into the wider region are now all too apparent, and we strongly
               support the EU playing its part to seek to prevent this from happening. The backdrop
               to this summit is that across Europe there is low or no growth. I am afraid on this
               fundamental issue the Prime Minister has yet again returned from a European summit
               with nothing to offer. So, first, can he tell us whether he had any responses to the
               proposals on the immediate growth crisis facing Europe that he took to the summit?
               Europe urgently needs co-ordinated action to boost demand, with those countries with
               the scope to do so taking action, but yet again there was nothing from the summit.
               Secondly, on the single market - which the Prime Minister makes great play of - he
               admitted that this summit simply reaffirmed what was agreed in June, but will he
               agree that the situation is actually slightly different from then?</seg>
            <seg>On energy, will he confirm that the conclusions were exactly the same as the
               Councils conclusions 18 months ago? On digital, they sounded familiar to me, too, and
               there is a reason: they were exactly the same as they were in October 2011 - a year
               ago. So when he said at his summit press conference, with characteristic humility:
               "Who is driving that agenda" - on energy, on digital - "which has made so much
               progress this year? It's Britain", what did he mean by that, because there has been
               no progress over the last year?</seg>
            <seg>Thirdly, on banking, there are big issues facing financial services as others move
               towards a banking union, but the summit conclusions are vague at this stage. So can
               the Prime Minister clarify for us what his key demands are in relation to the crucial
               issue of voting rights, as banking union goes ahead? Can he tell us what specific
               safeguards he will be seeking, and can he tell us how he will be building support for
               his position among our allies - using his enormous popularity, which he has built up
               over the past two and a half years? That takes me to the real problem the Prime
               Minister faced at this summit. At home last week, he was starring in his own version
               of The Thick of It. In Europe he was offering another chapter in his handbook of How
               to Lose Friends and Influence. This is what Finlands Europe Minister said</seg>

               <desc>Interruption</desc>
            </incident>
            <seg>Those on the Government Benches do not like to hear about their lack of influence
               in Europe. <quote>"This is what Finlands Europe Minister said at the summit: Britain
                  isputting itself in the margins... the boat is pulling away and one of our best
                  friends is somehow saying bye bye and theres not really that much we can do about
                  it."</quote>

            <seg>Some on the Government Benches are saying, <quote>"Hear, hear"</quote>, about
               leaving Europe; there is the problem for the Prime Minister. That is not the French
               or the Germans talking - it is Finland. Even the Prime Minister cannot be glorying in
               fisticuffs with Finland. It is the land of the Helsinki accords, reindeer and the
               Moomins. Its Europe Minister is an anglophile; he is one of Britains friends. The
               Prime Minister does not seem to realise that all his bluster about fighting for
               Britain is meaningless if he alienates our natural supporters. Will he confirm that
               he really has become the guy who goes to Europe and picks a fight in an empty room?
               That is just as well, because he normally finds himself in an empty room.</seg>
            <seg>The Prime Minister was asked about his isolation, and this is what he had to say:
                  <quote>"We are actually a very, very important and influential playerright there
                  in the vanguard".</quote> If he thinks that, the problem is not that he is
               isolated, it is that he is completely deluded about the arguments going on in Europe.
               Last October, he said: <quote>"This is not the time to argue about walking
                  away."</quote>
               <note>Official Report, 24 October 2011; Vol. 534, c. 27.</note>
            </seg>
            <seg>But that is exactly what his Cabinet is now doing. <incident>
                  <desc>Interruption</desc>
               </incident> The Education Secretary has chosen to walk away from this statement, but
               the Eurosceptic beauty contest has begun, with the Education Secretary, the party
               chairman and others joining the fray. The reality is that the Prime Minister has lost
               control of his party on Europe. We have a Prime Minister who is outside the room
               looking in at Britains empty seat at the table. There is one thing that our allies in
               Europe and the British people can agree onhis Government are a shambles and it is
               Britain that suffers.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>I am sure that there was a question in there somewhere. Frankly, I am not going to
               take any lectures on Europe from a party that gave up part of Britains rebate and got
               nothing in return; that gave up the social chapter and got nothing in return; and
               that joined the EU bail-out fund and got absolutely nothing in return. It is this
               Government who introduced the referendum lock, who got us out of the bail-out
               mechanism and who will always stand up for Britain in Europe. I think that the right
               hon. Gentleman did ask a question somewhere at the beginning: what did Britain bring
               to Europes growth crisis? We brought, last week, falling unemployment, falling
               inflation and a million more people in work. He asks what we want in terms of banking
               union safeguards. We want single market safeguards, but I note that he had absolutely
               nothing positive to suggest on any of these agendas at all. The right hon. Gentleman
               talks about Britains influence in Europe. The single market in digital, in energy and
               in services is a British agenda that we are driving forward. He says that there has
               been no progress. There were never, under his Government, dates and specific actions
               for completing these markets, but there are now. Oil sanctions on Iran is a British
               agenda that we have succeeded in driving forward; pressure on Syria and support for
               the Arab spring countries is a British agenda; and trade deals with the US and with
               Japan, not just with Canada and Singapore, is a British agenda. What else did we get
               from the right hon. Gentleman? He talked about what I was doing at the European
               Council, but it is worth remembering that when I was there he was, of course,
               preparing for his great trade union sponsored march. I thought that the House might
               welcome an update on how the sponsored walk went: Unite union - £6 million; Unison -
               £3.2 million; and the GMB - £3.2 million. That is what he was doingcalling for
               general strikes and disruptionwhen we are fighting for Britain.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#TAPSELL">
            <seg>When the Prime Minister made it admirably clear to Chancellor Merkel that Britain
               would not permit the European Banking Authority or the European Central Bank to have
               any control or oversight of the Bank of England, what was her response?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>The point I would make to Chancellor Merkel - we do not actually fundamentally
               disagree about this - is that the single currency needs a banking union. At the heart
               of that banking union will be the ECB, with a new role as a banking regulator. But
               clearly as this country is not in the single currency our banking regulator will
               continue to be the Bank of England, and there will not be any question of the ECB
               having a say over the Bank of England - that is not the situation. Strangely enough,
               in a way the challenge is to persuade countries of the eurozone to go far enough in
               having a banking union that will help to break the link between banks that are in
               difficulty and sovereigns that are in difficulty. Just as we have a solid banking
               union for our single currency in the United Kingdom, they need a solid banking union
               for their single currency in the eurozone.</seg>

            <seg>Did the Prime Minister make it clear - by the way, his use of United Kingdom versus
               Britain is improving, but it is not yet good enough - to the other European leaders
               that we would not contribute towards any of the millions of pounds that the European
               Commission wishes to spend to tell every European Union citizen how wonderful the EU
               is? Is that not a ridiculous waste of money?</seg>

            <seg>I am very grateful to the hon. Lady for her school report and I shall continue to
               try to improve on my use of United Kingdom rather than anything else. On the issue of
               what the European Commission and European Union spend, as we get into this budget
               debate we should still look at the 6% of the money spent on the EUs central costs and
               the fact that, as I said at the weekend, some 16% of Commission officials are paid
               more than 100,000 a year. Okay, 6% is a small percentage of the total but it is still
               meaningful in getting a good budget deal.</seg>

               the reported advice of the Council's legal adviser and the inherent impact of the
               proposals on our national interest, will he veto the proposals, not least because the
               proposed voting changes would expose the City of London to qualified majority voting,

               the eurozone needs a banking union. We should be putting our negotiating heft, as it
               were, towards ensuring that those of us remaining outside the banking union have
               proper safeguards. Let me make one last point: I am sure that my hon. Friend knows

               not need to be part of the banking union discussions because we are never going to
               enter the currency. Will he confirm that, on a lot of other points, we are at the
               heart of the discussion, including on keeping the European budget down?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>My hon. Friend makes an extremely intelligent point. The creation of the single
               currency has created a different dynamic in Europe. Inevitably, if countries are not
               in and do not want to join the single currency, they will not be involved in every
               single discussion about the future of the single currency. That is what has created
               different pathways in the European Union. We must be mature about and accept that
               fact, and think, Now we know it, how can we best protect and defend the British
               interest in the EU? She makes a very important point.</seg>

         <u who="#MOWAT">
            <seg>Much of the discussion this afternoon has been on the need to protect our banking
               industry from regulation. For the avoidance of doubt, will the Prime Minister confirm
               that all our other exporting industries, such as pharmaceuticals, energy and oil,
               will be given the same respect in our negotiating position?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>Of coursemy hon. Friend makes an important point. I am not saying that we should
               stand up just for financial services and not for other industries. The industries he
               mentions are extremely important. However, we account for around 40% of the EUs
               financial services, so it is an important industry. I am not a mercantilist, but it
               is one industry segment in which we have a substantial positive trade balance with
               the EU. A British Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary or Business Secretary would not
               be doing their duty if they did not speak up and point out some of the dangers of not
               having reasonable outcomes on those issues, but my hon. Friend is absolutely right
               that many other industries benefit from being members of the EU and from ensuring
               that we are writing fair rules for the single market.</seg>

            <seg>My constituents will be horrified at any suggestion to increase the EU budget or
               the UKs contribution to it at a time of such austerity here. I can assure my right
               hon. Friend that the vast majority of my constituents want him to stick to his guns
               on the multi-year settlement, to get a good deal for the UK, and to do what is best
               for the UK. Will he assure my constituents that they will be pleased with the outcome
               when the time comes?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>I can certainly give my hon. Friend the assurance that we will stick to our
               position on that. I cannot tell him when a deal will be doneit does not have to be
               done this November. The important point is that the British position on not wanting
               real-terms increases will stay in place whether the deal is done in 2012, 2013, 2014
               or at any point in future. That is the key thing that everyone needs to know.</seg>

         <u who="#LEWIS">
            <seg>Thank you, Mr Speaker. Can the eurozone have a banking union that works without
               that leading to economic and political union too?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>I think that the short answer to that question is no. Over time, the more there is
               a banking union and a fiscal union, the tighter the political union will be drawn,
               becausefor instanceGerman voters having to stand behind Greek deposits, or French
               voters having to pay for the restructuring of a Spanish bank are deeply political
               questions. In my view, as the eurozone deepens its commitments, as is inevitable for
               a working single currency, there will be pressures for further political union, and
               for further treaties and treaty changes. That is why I believe it is possible for
               Britain to seek a new settlement and seek fresh consent on that settlement, but we
               have to show some patience, because right now the issue in Europe is how to firefight
               the problems of the eurozoneget down interest rates and get the eurozone economy
               movingrather than thinking through all the consequences of banking union and fiscal
               union in the way that my hon. Friend suggests.</seg>
