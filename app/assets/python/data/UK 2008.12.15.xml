               family and friends of Corporal Lee Churcher, of the Royal Engineers, who died while
               serving in Iraq, and Corporal Marc Birch, Marine Damian Davies, Lance-Corporal Jamie
               Fellows and Sergeant John Manuel of the Royal Marines, who lost their lives in
               Afghanistan. This is a tragic loss. We owe them and all those who have lost their
               lives in the service of our country our gratitude for their service and sacrifice. As
               a House and as a nation, we will never forget them. As I saw in Afghanistan on
               Saturday, our troops are serving with great skill, great courage and enormous
               dedication. It can truly be said that Britains armed forces are the best in the
               world, and we are immensely proud of all who serve in them.</seg>
            <seg>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the European
               Council held last Thursday and Friday, and on my visits to Afghanistan, India and
               Pakistan this weekend. The European summit focused on two global challenges -
               economic recovery and climate change. I can report, first of all, that the Council
               agreed measures worth around 1.5 per cent. of European GDP - that is, around 200
               billion - which will provide a fiscal stimulus for the European economy. This 1.5 per
               cent. fiscal boost is in addition to the work of the automatic stabilisers. The
               measures agreed included support for <quote>"increased public spending, judicious
                  reductions in tax burdens and direct aid to households, especially those which are
                  most vulnerable"</quote> - exactly the measures that Britain has already taken,
               just as France has announced a package of measures worth 26 billion, Spain measures
               worth 11 billion, and Germany a fiscal package worth 32 billion.</seg>
            <seg>Just as Europe came together in October and November to lead the recapitalisation
               of the banks, so too Europe has agreed unanimously co-ordinated action which will
               support employment and growth. The Council agreed that its action was in a
                  <quote>"united, strong, rapid and decisive manner"</quote>, and while committing
               to medium-term sustainable public finances, it agreed to <quote>"mobilise all the
                  instruments available to it".</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>By acting in a co-ordinated and concerted way, the impact on jobs in each country
               is much greater than if we acted on our own, and the action across Europe will be of
               help to Britain, where nearly 60 per cent. of our trade is with the rest of Europe.
               The co-ordinated European action includes a speeding up of public procurement, a
               continued and general <quote>"reduction in administrative burdens on
                  business"</quote>, and an additional 30 billion from the European Investment Bank
               to be invested in Britain and throughout Europe in the coming year.</seg>
            <seg>So the debate about the use of fiscal policy to stimulate our economy and to give
               direct support for families and businesses in Europe is resolved. Europe favours
               substantial fiscal stimulus alongside cuts in interest rates. I am confident that the
               new American Administration of President-elect Obama will also introduce a large
               fiscal stimulus. This European set of announcements is the answer to those who said
               that nothing could be done and that the recession must take its course, and who
               believe that fiscal policy has no role to play. Indeed, even at this time of
               difficulty, they believe that public spending should be cut.</seg>
            <seg>To back up the loan guarantee scheme, the export credits and the deferral of tax,
               today the Chancellor will announce new measures to speed up the resumption of lending
               to businesses and home owners, and the Minister for Housing will announce a 400
               million package of measures which, building on our help with mortgages to avoid
               repossessions, will help up to 18,000 first-time buyers draw on the home shared
               equity scheme to get on their first rung on the housing ladder - real help to
               families and businesses now, possible only because we are prepared to make a fiscal
               stimulus in the economy.</seg>
            <seg>In advance of Copenhagen next year, the summit agreed a new energy and climate
               change policy supported by all member states. When it is approved by the European
               Parliament, as I believe it will be, the programme will put into European law four
               far-reaching commitments: a 20 per cent. cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020,
               which, as part of the right international agreement, we will raise to 30 per cent.; a
               target that 20 per cent. of the European Unions energy will come from renewables by
               2020; a strengthened European Union emissions trading scheme with 100 per cent.
               auctioning of permits in the power sector, the introduction of auctioning for other
               sectors of the economy and help to ensure that businesses in international markets
               can adjust; and a financing mechanism to make potentially around 9 billion available
               for the commercial demonstration of carbon capture and storage.</seg>
            <seg>Carbon capture is a transformative technology that every major economy will need,
               to ensure that it can continue to use coal, oil and gas without contributing to
               climate change. These commitments make Europe the first continent to make legally
               binding the detailed policies required to set itself on a path to a low-carbon
               economy. They provide a clear signal to the rest of the world that an international
               agreement on climate change can be achieved in Copenhagen next year. This was matched
               by agreement at the United Nations talks in Poznan at the same time, where a
               framework for countering deforestation was agreed. Britain will make a contribution
               of 100 million to that from our environmental transformation fund for sustainable
               forestry activities in developing countries.</seg>
            <seg>At the European Council, agreement was also reached on measures to answer concerns
               expressed to us by Ireland. All countries were agreed that there could be no change
               or amendment to the Lisbon treaty and that we should proceed to ratification, with
               the Irish agreeing to hold a referendum within the next year. At the same time, to
               meet Irish concerns, it was agreed: that the Lisbon treaty, as we have always made
               clear, in no way affects the rights of member states to make taxation decisions; that
               the treaty in no way affects the individual defence policies of member states,
               including our obligations to NATO and Irelands traditional neutrality; and that
               because, as we have been clear, the charter of fundamental rights creates no new
               rights at a European Union level, the Irish constitution provisions on the right to
               life, education and family are not affected by its incorporation into the treatynor
               are they affected by the justice and home affairs provisions of the treaty from which
               Ireland has an opt-out. The Lisbon treaty allows for the Council, by a unanimous
               decision, to agree to ensure that each member state retains a Commissionerand this,
               we stated, we would be prepared to agree to.</seg>
            <seg>The Council also made an important statement on the middle east process. The
               Council welcomed efforts to give renewed momentum to the Arab peace initiative and
               affirmed that the EU will do all it can, practically and politically, to support the
               peace process and to urge the new US Administration to make it a major priority in
               the new year.</seg>
            <seg>Let me turn to Afghanistan, India and Pakistan. I have already paid tribute to, and
               I reiterate, the service, sacrifice and dedication of our armed forces. Today, I can
               inform the House that the increased compensation payments have come into forcea
               doubling, for the most serious injuries, to a new maximum lump sum of 570,000 for
               armed forces personnel wounded in action or otherwise, an increase that means that
               around 10 million will be paid to 2,700 troops who have been awarded lump-sum
               payments.</seg>
            <seg>While in Afghanistan, I and the Chief of the Defence Staff met President Karzai and
               took stock of our strategy with commanders and senior officials. We saw at first hand
               the hard and dangerous work that the armed forces are doing in very arduous
               conditions, far from home. Our goals in Afghanistan are clear: to support democracy
               and confront terror at its source; to build the Afghan capability by training its
               army and police to spread the rule of law into empty spaces on the map which shelter
               terrorism, narcotics and other problems; in all this, to root out corruption, respect
               local ways of life and strengthen traditional Afghan structures; and to give Afghan
               people an economic stake in the future.</seg>
            <seg>Free and fair elections are an essential part of Afghans taking control of their
               own security and destiny. So as we approach the Afghan elections planned for next
               year, on top of the work that we are doing with NATO and the Afghan army to ensure
               security for those elections, we are pledging to contribute $10 million to help with
               voter registration. In return for this renewed commitment, and others, that we will
               make from Britain, I have asked for quicker progress on the decisions at the NATO
               summit on burden sharing, and I have asked President Karzai for leadership in
               tackling corruption. For our part, we are offering a multi-agency taskforce which we
               are ready to send immediately to tackle corruption. Five years on from the first free
               and fair elections Afghanistan has seen in decades, we should reflect on what has
               been achieved. As Governor Mangal of Helmand, whom I met on Saturday, said,
                  <quote>"it has been a hard year for our brave police and soldiers, but it has been
                  a much harder year for our enemies who have found through experience that they
                  cannot defeat us".</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>Today, with 5 million refugees returning to Afghanistan, 4 million more children in
               school, great improvements in health care, including massive reductions in child
               mortality, and the national income up 70 per cent., our task is to ensure that
               violence and insecurity do not threaten that progress. Security depends on proper
               burden sharing. In recent weeks we have had to respond to the threat from insurgents
               in the district of Nad-e Ali near the provincial capital of Helmand. The operation
               involves 1,800 troops, not just from Britain but from Denmark, the USA and Estonia.
               It is a model of burden sharing that we need to see replicated across the whole of
               Afghanistan. Forty-one countries are involved in the NATO mission, but the burden is
               not always shared equally. As the international community and the American
               President-elect contemplate strengthening our commitment to Afghanistan, it is vital
               that all members of the coalition contribute fairly. This will be a subject of the
               NATO meeting on 3 and 4 April.</seg>
            <seg>The second pillar of security in Afghanistan is enabling the Afghan people to take
               greater control of their own affairs by training thousands of Afghan soldiers and
               thousands of police. With our help, Governor Mangal is starting to work with tribal
               leaders, whom I met in Musa Qalaa place that only last year was in Taliban hands, but
               is now building basic services such as roads, power and water, and new schools and
               hospitals, which are having a tangible impact on the lives of Afghan people. This is
               starting to bring to Helmand the wider progress that we have seen in other parts of
               Afghanistan. To reinforce this progress, and having been briefed on the decision by
               the British commanderas is his rightto call forward reserves to work with our allies
               and deploy them on a temporary basis in the campaign in central Helmand, the Defence
               Secretary and I have decided, on advice from the defence chiefs, to approve until
               August, including the period of preparation for the elections, an increase in the
               number of British troops deployed to Afghanistan from just over 8,000 to around
               8,300.</seg>
            <seg>We, the Americans and the international community as a whole increasingly recognise
               that we cannot deal with Afghanistan in isolation from Pakistan. There is a chain of
               terror that links the mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan right through to the
               streets of the UK and other countries around the world, and that chain of terror must
               be broken. On 27 November, the whole world learned that terrorists based in Pakistan
               can strike anywhere, when a murderous assault condemned by the whole world saw 12
               terrorists kill 175 people in Mumbai, including British citizens. This weekend, I met
               Prime Minister Singh and President Zardari to discuss action that now has to be
               taken. I expressed my condolences to Dr. Singh, and through him to the Indian people,
               and assured him that the whole of Britain stands fully alongside India in its
               determination to see those responsible brought to justice.</seg>
            <seg>I pay tribute to the efforts in Pakistan to deny the federally administered tribal
               areas as a training ground for terrorism and for the insurgency in Afghanistan and
               for terrorism. Indeed, more than 100 Pakistani troops have died since July this year
               in that area. Plots hatched in the FATA have a direct impact on the UK: of the
               security services top-priority terrorist investigations, three quarters have links to
               Pakistan. So our commitment to countering terrorism and the empty spaces that shelter
               terrorism, and to building local capacity in Pakistan to do so, must be just as
               strong in Pakistan as in Afghanistan. The time has come not for more words but for
               more action. We will offer our support to the democratically elected Government of
               Pakistan, but that Government must act rapidly and decisively against the terror
               networks based on their soil. Pakistans own future depends on action against those
               within its borders who are bent on the destruction of its elected Government and
               Pakistans relations with its neighbours. To make this effective, Britain will work
               with both India and Pakistan to continue building counter-terrorism capability.
               Yesterday, I was able to announce more help on bomb disposal capability, scanning
               devices and airport security, and help to draw up new laws and to set up
               counter-extremism centres. Our assistance programme to Pakistan is the most
               comprehensive we have with any country, and will now include a programme, initially
               worth 6 million, to tackle the causes of radicalisation.</seg>
            <seg>No matter how serious the other tasks we face, security is the first duty of
               Government. We will always maintain our vigilance against the evils of terrorism. I
               commend this statement to the House.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>I join the Prime Minister in paying tribute to our servicemen Marine Damian Davies,
               Sergeant John Manuel, Corporal Marc Birch and Lance-Corporal Jamie Fellows, who were
               all killed in Afghanistan, and Corporal Lee Churcher, who was killed in Basra. It is
               particularly poignant talking about their families tragic loss at this time of year,
               but it should remind us of the bravery our troops show every day of the year. Let me
               deal with the Prime Ministers visits first. On Afghanistan, one of the lessons of
               Iraq was that the Government must give clear and frank assessments of what is
               happening on the ground. Does he agree that there are real causes for concern? The
               Taliban are operating closer and closer to Kabul, the road network is increasingly
               unsafe, and the number of Taliban and their armaments appear to be growing rather
               than shrinking. Does he agree that as well as a realistic assessment of conditions,
               we need a realistic mission? Should it not focus predominantly on security and
               rooting out terrorist training, not on an unrealistic objective of completely
               transforming a society thousands of miles away?</seg>
            <seg>Clearly, our servicemen and women are doing a great job, but what about the others
               who are key to success? Can the Prime Minister tell us more about the representations
               he made to President Karzai, not just about fraud in his Government, but about drug
               dealing by those associated with them, and corruption by public officials? On troop
               numbers, the Petraeus review is vital and it would be helpful if the Prime Minister
               could tell us about our contribution to that review, but surely we should send more
               troops only if there is a proper political strategy to help to deliver security, if
               there is more effective burden sharing with our NATO allies and if there is a
               corresponding increase in vital equipment, especially Chinook helicopters and
               armoured vehicles.</seg>
            <seg>Just as important is progress in Pakistan. Does the Prime Minister agree that the
               British public will not understand why we are making sacrifices to prevent terrorist
               training camps from being established in Afghanistan if they are still operating
               across the border in Pakistan? He said that he received assurances from President
               Zardari about taking action, but what is the Prime Ministers assessment of the
               ability of the Pakistan army, and the Pakistan intelligence services, to deliver on
               the commitments that he was given? Did he raise those matters directly with the
               Pakistan chief of general staff, General Kayani?</seg>
            <seg>Turning to Mumbai, I know that the Prime Minister agrees that we must strengthen
               our relationship with India. Can he tell us more about the close co-operation we need
               between our security services? Clearly, this style of attack on a major city in an
               open society is a new tactic. Can the Prime Minister tell the House what the
               Government will do to address that threat here?</seg>
            <seg>Turning to the European Council, on climate change we support the so-called
               20/20/20 package, but will the Prime Minister confirm that the UK target for
               renewables is actually lower than 20 per cent., at 15 per cent. of total energy
               consumption by 2020? Would he accept that this environmental agreement shows that it
               is possible for Europe to take important decisions on important issues without new
               treaties and without new constitutions? The Lisbon treaty, by the way, has just seven
               words on the environment; that is all that it has on the subject. On the Lisbon
               treaty -</seg>
            <incident>
               <desc>Interruption</desc>
            </incident>
            <seg>- Yes, I read it, actually - Europes leaders had to make a big decision: do they
               respect the wishes of the people? The answer was a resounding no. Just what is it
               with this Prime Minister and elections? An unelected Prime Minister wants to force
               the Irish people to vote twice because he did not like the result the first time, and
               he refuses to allow the British people to vote once because he is afraid that he
               would not like the result of that, either. Does he agree that one of the advantages
               of an early election here in Britain would be that the Lisbon treaty could be put to
               the people in a referendum, and we could let them decide?</seg>
            <seg>Turning to the economic package, the Prime Minister makes three claims. First, he
               says that Britain is well prepared. If that is true, can he tell us why the pound has
               fallen to another record low? Is he aware that this lunchtime, his Olympics Minister
               said that Britain is <quote>"facing a recession deeper than any that we have known,
                  almost certainly"</quote>? So is it not clear that we are not well prepared?</seg>
            <seg>Secondly, the Prime Minister says that those in the EU all agreed with him that
               every country should take part in the same sort of fiscal stimulus, regardless of
               their situation. So why does the European Commission statement for the Council state:
                  <quote>"It is clear that not all Member States are in the same position. Those
                  that took advantage of the good times to achieve more sustainable public finance
                  positions... have more room for manoeuvre now"</quote>. The Prime Minister did not
               read that out. It continues: <quote>"For those Member States, in particular those
                  outside the euro area, which are facing significant imbalances, budgetary policy
                  should essentially aim at correcting such imbalances".</quote> In other words,
                  <quote>"If you're in a hole like the one the Prime Minister has put us into, stop
                  digging".</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>Thirdly, the Prime Minister said that he is setting the agenda with his particular
               measureshe is leafing through his papers to try to find them. Let us take VAT. The
               French Finance Minister said: <quote>"As far as were concerned...were not certain
                  that when prices go down, a VAT reduction is that effective".</quote> The German
               Social Democrat budget spokesman said that the cut in VAT was
               counter-productive.</seg>
            <seg>That brings me to the Germans. I note that the Prime Minister did not really
               mention themor perhaps he did once, but he thinks he got away with it. Is not it true
               that the German Finance Minister - another Social Democrat, by the way - has
               completely blown the Prime Ministers credibility out of the water? He described his
               approach as <quote>"crass"</quote> and mistaken. He criticised Britains debt, which
               he believes will <quote>"take a whole generation to work off"</quote>.</seg>
            <seg>In response, the Prime Minister claims that Germanys fiscal expansion backs up his
               own plans. However, Germany went into the downturn with a budget surplus; it fixed
               the roof when the sun was shining. In contrast, the Prime Minister led Britain into
               the downturn with the largest budget deficit in the industrialised world. Next, he
               claimed that this was all to do with internal German politics, but has not that claim
               been shattered, too? The Christian Democrats budget spokesman said that the German
               Finance Ministers comments have <quote>"nothing whatsoever to do with internal German
                  politics... the tremendous amount of debt being offered by Britain shows a
                  complete failure of Labour policy".</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>The Prime Minister is always telling us that he wants a consensus. He certainly got
               one in Germany: they all think that he has got it wrong. With the EU Council in mind,
               will the Prime Minister act to deal with what the Governor of the Bank of England
               says is the most pressing challenge: getting banks lending again? Will he adopt our
               proposal for a national loan guarantee scheme? I have the draft Bill here. Will he
               support it, so that we can get business trading and Britain out of the recession?
               Instead of dreaming about saving the world, when will the Prime Minister start saving
               businesses here in Britain?</seg>

         <u who="#BROWN">
            <seg>Let me say first of all that I agree with what the right hon. Gentleman says about
               the losses of life in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is particularly poignant, as we face
               Christmas, that so many families will be without their loved ones as a result of
               those deaths. I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his support for what we are doing
               on Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. Our plan in Afghanistan is clear: to complement
               the military action that we have to takebecause this is the front line against the
               Talibanby helping Afghan people take more control of their lives and have a stake in
               the future. To do thatyes, we must tackle corruption. That is why we have offered
               President Karzai a multi-agency taskforce, which we will put at his side in Kabul to
               help him deal with the problems. It is also why we have taken the necessary action to
               increase our troop numbers in central Helmand so that they can deal with the Taliban
               in that vital area of Helmand.</seg>
            <seg>When I was in Musa Qala, I could see that a place that the Taliban held a year ago
               is now a place where there is law and order. A school and a hospital had just been
               built and opened as a result of the investment that we and others are making. Afghan
               people are now taking control of the judiciary system and law and order in that area.
               If that can be done in Musa Qala, it can be done in other parts of the region. I have
               to dispute what the right hon. Gentleman says about the money that we are providing
               for helicopters and vehicles. We announced only last week more provision for
               helicopters, and we have spent 1 billion on vehicles. We are determined that our
               troops have the best and most modern equipment. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman
               that we must deal with the root of the problems in Pakistan, and I support what
               President Zardari is doing. I did meet General Kayani and talked to him about his
               responsibilities and those of the Pakistani army and the ISI to ensure that
               terrorists who have operated from Pakistan to do damage in India are properly rooted
               out, that the training camps of TEL are closed down and that order is brought back to
               the FATA areas. I believe that General Kayani shares President Zardaris view that
               those things must be done, so that Pakistan can show the world that it is taking the
               action that is necessary.</seg>
            <seg>I now turn to the European meeting. The right hon. Gentleman did not say much about
               climate change, but he questioned whether we were doing enough. I believe that the
               agreement that we have reached on a 20 per cent. cut in emissions by 2020 is an
               historic agreement. This is the first time that 27 countries have come together, and
               that was possible only because we are part of the European Union. It is now possible
               to move forward to the next stage, which is to win a worldwide treaty at Copenhagen,
               because the European Unionand, hopefully, the American Governmentcan join together in
               taking the action that is necessary.</seg>
            <seg>As for Ireland, let me repeat to the right hon. Gentleman that the agreement to
               meet Irish concerns means that the Lisbon treaty in no way affects the rights of
               member states to make taxation decisions or individual member states defence
               policiesboth things that we in Britain have always insisted on. We have also made it
               clear that the charter of fundamental rights creates no new rights at the EU level.
               That is something that we have always insisted on, and which the Irish now want as
               part of their protocol. Therefore, it was perfectly proper for us to support the
               Irish in their determination to get those three things made absolutely clear, as well
               as to have a Commissioner of their own.</seg>
            <seg>The right hon. Gentleman talked about what the European Union is doing on the
               economy, but it is interesting to read what President Sarkozy has said:
                  <quote>"Everybody agrees that there is a need for economic recovery along the
                  lines of the... Barroso plan, around 1.5 per cent."</quote> and what Chancellor
               Merkel has said: <quote>"Germany has.. .declared its willingness with regard to this
                  1.5 per cent.... You know... in January we will discuss the matter of further
                  steps."</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>The one thing that the right hon. Gentleman tries to deny, by quoting people whom
               he would never quote in ordinary circumstancesGerman Finance Ministers and European
               Union politiciansis the one thing that is absolutely true: that the whole of the rest
               of Europe wants a fiscal stimulus, and wants it to complement the interest rate cuts
               that are being made. The Conservative party does not even have the Czech social forum
               with it on this occasion. Not one of the leading parties in Europe supports the
               position of the Conservative party. Why is that the case? Because the Conservative
               party has committed itself not only to doing nothing during this period, but to
               public spending cuts. The Conservatives say that they will cut public spending from
               2010. Just at the point when people need help, they revert to the old policies of the
               1980s and 1990s. That is what made people think of the Conservative party as the
               nasty party. The Conservatives will give no help to home owners and no help to small
               businesses, because they will spend no money. They have announced support for a
               national business guarantee scheme, but there is no public money behind it, as a
               result of their decisions to cut public spending, and there is no help for the
               unemployed. This is the Conservative party that we are coming to see. At a time when
               people need help at Christmas, the Conservatives would pull the help away. It is the
               same old uncaring Conservative party of the past.</seg>

               friends of Lee Churcher, who, sadly, died in Iraq? We all owe them a huge debt for
               their service and sacrifice.</seg>
            <seg>Like so many European Union summits before it, last weeks summit was stronger on
               words than action, richer in promises than in delivery. I welcome the summit
               proposals for a fiscal stimulus to boost the economy, in the shape of tax cuts and
               public investment. The question, then, is: why is the Prime Minister not properly
               practising here at home what he has preached in the European Union? Instead of having
               his short-term VAT cut, why will he not make the big, permanent, fair tax cuts for
               ordinary families that were called for at the European summit? Instead of wasting
               extra borrowed money on that VAT cut, why will the Prime Minister not invest in green
               infrastructure for Britains future, creating green jobs and green growth, as were
               also called for at the summit? Does the Prime Minister not see that if he does not
               boost growth in that waypermanent tax cuts and green jobsBritain will fall behind
               those countries in Europe that he has been boasting about beating for about a decade?
               Already, in some places one can no longer buy a whole euro for a pound. Does the
               Prime Minister recognise that many eurozone economies could surge ahead of Britain,
               under his leadership, leaving us once again as the sick man of Europe?</seg>
            <seg>The summit was a wasted opportunity to defeat climate change. All those of us who
               want our children to have a planet worth living on will be disappointed that dirty
               industry has been given extra time to clean up its act. Will the Prime Minister tell
               us when the commitments will be reviewed, and when the loopholes for dirty industry
               will finally be closed? The Prime Minister also told us about his visits to
               Afghanistan, India and Pakistan. I welcome his words of commitment to those countries
               and support the temporary increase of troops until August in Afghanistan. Does he now
               recognise that any lasting peace in that country will have to come from a regional
               agreementlike the Dayton peace accords in the Balkansand that we need to start
               talking now to China, Russia and Iran? Does he also agree that, if the local
               pragmatists in the Taliban are to be split from the national fundamentalists, the
               talks with the moderate Taliban that are going on in the shadows need to be brought
               out into the light and given new emphasis?</seg>
            <seg>Finally, I was disturbed to see that Zimbabwe warranted only a few words in the
               conclusions of the summit, even as millions face disease and starvation, and no words
               at all from the Prime Minister this afternoon. The Government have got their
               priorities wrong: instead of being tough on Mugabe, they are being tough on his
               victims, by refusing to allow Zimbabwean asylum seekers here to work, and, despite
               assurances to the contrary, by still deporting Zimbabweans to their fateincluding
               Privilege Thalambo, who was arrested with her two daughters for deportation just last
               Friday. The Prime Minister talks with great passion about Africa, but he is not
               providing the right leadership. He has given the wrong leadership on the Congo. Why,
               instead of encouraging EU leaders to send EU troops, has he encouraged them not to
               send them? He has also given the wrong leadership on Zimbabwe. Why has he not pushed
               for international action by the United Nations under the new doctrine of
               responsibility to protect? Does the Prime Minister not agree that, on the economy, on
               climate change and on Africa, making the right promises is the easy bit, but
               delivering them is the real test?</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BROWN">
            <seg>The right hon. Gentlemans whole theme was that the summit was stronger on words
               than on action; if any group in the world is stronger on words than on action, it is
               the Liberal party. I shall answer individually each of the questions that the right
               hon. Gentleman has asked. On troops in Afghanistan, I am grateful for his support for
               the additional mission to ensure that central Helmand is free of the Taliban.</seg>
            <seg>On Zimbabwe, I disagree that we have done little; we have done a huge amount to try
               to get humanitarian aid to the people who are affected by cholera, to persuade the
               southern African states to take the necessary action, to bring this forward to the
               Security Council, as we are doing, and to ensure that the whole world understands the
               blood-stained regime that we are dealing with in Zimbabwe. We will continue our
               efforts to try to persuade African leaders to take a tougher stand on the
               issue.</seg>
            <seg>On the Congo, I think that the right hon. Gentleman realises that, in preference to
               rushing to deploy an EU force at the moment, the most important thing is to
               strengthen the UN force. It is to rise from 17,000 to 20,000, and we have put aside
               some money to help the recruiting of the additional troops for work in the Congo. By
               far the quickest and most effective way of getting help to people there, and of
               dealing with the incursions that are taking place, is to strengthen the numbers, the
               quality and the leadership of the UN force on the ground. On climate change, I also
               disagree with the right hon. Gentleman. There is a debate to be had about carbon
               leakage, and there is to be a rigorous examination of its impact. No action will be
               taken to exclude the non-power sectors of the economy from auctioning until that
               rigorous examination has been carried out. The proposals will then go back to the
               Council for further discussion within six months, so that we can be clear that carbon
               leakage is not being used as an excuse to escape responsibility for taking action on
               climate change. Our objectives of a 20 per cent. cut in emissions, of 100 per cent.
               power auctioning and of a 9 billion commitment to carbon capture and storage were all
               achieved at the summit, and, for all the difficulties that the right hon. Gentleman
               has raised about carbon leakagea matter that has still to come back to be discussed
               in full laterthere have been enormous advances that will put Europe in a position to
               take the lead in Copenhagen in securing a climate change agreement.</seg>
            <seg>I know that the right hon. Gentleman does not favour the VAT cuts that have taken
               place, but I believe that they are already making a difference, and I hope that he
               will support the increase in public spending that is taking place as a result of
               decisions that we have made. Not only has 5 billion already been allocated to small
               businesses, with a great deal more to come, but a 10 billion increase in the capital
               budget from last year to next year will enable us to proceed with our plans for
               roads, transport, schools and hospitals in a way that will employ more people. I hope
               that the Liberal party will continue to support that action, which is necessary to
               inject more capital spending into the economy at a time when it is most needed.</seg>
            <seg>The fact of the matter is that monetary policy has a transmission mechanism that is
               impaired, and we cannot rely totally on monetary policy. No other major country in
               the world is saying that monetary policy alone can do this work, apart from the
               people who represent the Conservative party at the moment. Fiscal policy is
               absolutely essential, especially at a time of low inflation and low interest rates:
               the case for using fiscal policy is even stronger then. It is unfortunate that the
               Conservatives have not learned the basic lesson of the 1970s and 1980s that a
               recession is prolonged by a failure to invest and a failure to use capital spending.
               The Liberals and I are agreed on the need for capital investment. The Conservative
               party should go back to the drawing board and think again.</seg>

               policy is important is that we are in a period of low inflation with low interest
               rateslow inflation next year, following the low interest rates we currently have.
               That is why fiscal policy can have the greatest effect. If the Conservative party is
               going to say that this is the right time to stop building schools, to stop building
               hospitals, to cut back on transport and to cut back on the roads, and to say that it
               will severely cut public spending from 2010 onwards, it will have to explain why it
               is making nurses, doctors, teachers and others unemployed. That is the policy of the

            <seg>No, and I would have thought that when the right hon. Gentleman looked at the Irish
               statement as a result of the European Council, he would support most of it, not
               oppose it.</seg>

            <seg>In relation to matters discussed at the European Council, does the Prime Minister
               agree that one of the things that will be vital to long-term economic recovery is
               ensuring that strategically important industries can weather the current storm and
               prosper into the future? In that context, will he say a little more about efforts
               being made at a European level in relation to the automotive industry, whose health
               is vital to many EU member states?</seg>

         <u who="#BROWN">
            <seg>Decisions on the automotive industry will be made by individual countries, which
               will look at the situation and make their own judgments about what is likely to
               happen. My hon. Friends question prompts a more fundamental question about whether
               one is prepared to help families and businesses in times of great difficulty. We are
               prepared to do so; the Opposition would not.</seg>

            <seg>The evidence is that the position of the international community, including the
               Karzai Government, in Afghanistan is becoming more difficult day by day. It is also
               evident that public support in the UK for our troops in Afghanistan is declining
               rather than increasing. The Prime Minister is conducting this important and
               much-needed review of policy towards Afghanistan. Can the House of Commons have the
               opportunity to contribute to the review through at least a day, but preferably two
               days, of debate before it is completed?</seg>

         <u who="#BROWN">
            <seg>We have regular debates in the House of Commons, such as the debate on defence that
               took place very recently. Of course a debate on Afghanistan can take place, if the
               Opposition choose to propose that subject. At the same time, we will keep the House
               fully informed of any decisions that we propose to make on Afghanistan.</seg>
