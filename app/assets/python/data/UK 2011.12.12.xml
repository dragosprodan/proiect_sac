            <seg>With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on last weeks

         </u>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>Thank you, Mr Speaker. I went to Brussels with one objective: to protect Britains
               national interest, and that is what I did. Let me refer to what I said to the House
               last Wednesday. I made it clear that if the eurozone countries wanted a treaty
               involving all 27 members of the European Union, we would insist on some safeguards
               for Britain to protect our own national interests. Some thought that the safeguards I
               was asking for were relatively modest. Nevertheless, satisfactory safeguards were not
               forthcoming, so I did not agree to the treaty. Let me be clear about exactly what
               happened, what it means for Britain and what I see happening next.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#RUANE">

         <u who="#SPEAKER">
            <seg>Order. I apologise for interrupting the Prime Minister. I hope that Members have
               now got it out of their system. The statement will be heard. Right hon. and hon.
               Members on both sides of the House will have ample opportunity to question the Prime
               Minister, but courtesy and parliamentary convention dictate that the statement will
               be heard.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me take the House through the events of last week. At
               this Council, the eurozone economies agreed that there should be much tighter fiscal
               discipline in the eurozone as part of restoring market confidence. That is something
               that Britain recognises as necessary in a single currency. We want the eurozone to
               sort out its problems. That is in Britains national interest because the crisis in
               the eurozone is having a chilling effect on Britains economy too, so the question at
               the Council was not whether there should be greater fiscal discipline in the
               eurozone, but how it should be achieved.</seg>
            <seg>There were two possible outcomes: either a treaty of all 27 countries, with proper
               safeguards for Britain; or a separate treaty in which eurozone countries and others
               would pool their sovereignty on an intergovernmental basis, with Britain maintaining
               its position in the single market and in the European Union of 27 members. We went
               seeking a deal at 27 and I responded to the German and French proposal for treaty
               change in good faith, genuinely looking to reach an agreement at the level of the
               whole of the European Union, with the necessary safeguards for Britain. Those
               safeguardson the single market and on financial serviceswere modest, reasonable and
               relevant. We were not trying to create an unfair advantage for Britain. London is the
               leading centre for financial services in the world, and this sector employs 100,000
               people in Birmingham and a further 150,000 people in Scotland. It supports the rest
               of the economy in Britain and more widely in Europe.</seg>
            <seg>We were not asking for a UK opt-out, special exemption or a generalised emergency
               brake on financial services legislation. They were safeguards sought for the EU as a
               whole. We were simply asking for a level playing field for open competition for
               financial services companies in all EU countries, with arrangements that would enable
               every EU member state to regulate its financial sector properly. To those who say
               that we were trying to go soft on the banks, nothing could be further from the truth.
               We have said that we are going to respond positively to the tough measures set out in
               the Vickers report. There are issues about whether this can be done under current
               European regulations, so one of the things we wanted was to make sure we could go
               further than European rules on regulating the banks. The Financial Services Authority
               report on RBS today demonstrates just how necessary that is <incident>
                  <desc>Interruption</desc>
               </incident> and perhaps instead of talking Opposition Members will remember their
               responsibility for the mess that they created.</seg>
            <seg>Those who say that this proposed treaty change was all about safeguarding the
               eurozone, and so Britain should not have tried to interfere or to insist on
               safeguards, are fundamentally wrong as well. The EU treaty is the treaty of those
               outside the euro as much as it is for those inside the euro, so creating a new
               eurozone treaty within the existing EU treaty without proper safeguards would have
               changed the EU for us, too. It would not just have meant a whole new bureaucracy,
               with rules and competences for the eurozone countries being incorporated directly
               into the EU treaty; it would have changed the nature of the EU strengthening the
               eurozone without balancing measures to strengthen the single market. Of course, an
               intergovernmental arrangement is not without risks, but we did not want to see that
               imbalance hard-wired into the treaty without proper safeguards. To those who believe
               that that was not a real risk, I tell them that France and Germany said in their
               letter last week that the eurozone should work on single market issues such as
               financial regulation and competitiveness. That is why we required safeguards, and I
               make no apology for it.</seg>
            <seg>Of course, I wish those safeguards had been accepted, but frankly I have to tell
               the House that the choice was a treaty without proper safeguards or no treatyand the
               right answer was no treaty. It was not an easy thing to do, but it was the right
               thing to do. As a result, eurozone countries and others are now making separate
               arrangements for the fiscal integration that they need to solve the problems in the
               eurozone. They recognise that this approach will be less attractive, more complex and
               more difficult to enforce, and they would prefer to incorporate the new treaty into
               the EU treaties in future. Our position remains the same.</seg>
            <seg>Let me turn to what this means for Britain. Britain remains a full member of the
               European Union, and the events of the last week do nothing to change that. Our
               membership of the EU is vital to our national interest. We are a trading nation, and
               we need the single market for trade, investment and jobs. The EU makes Britain a
               gateway to the largest single market in the world for investors; it secures half of
               our exports and millions of British jobs; and membership of the EU strengthens our
               ability to progress our foreign policy objectives, too, giving us a strong voice on
               the global stage on issues such as trade and, as we have seen in Durban this week,
               climate change and the environment.</seg>
            <seg>So we are in the European Union and we want to be. This week there will be meetings
               of the Councils on Transport, Telecommunications and Energy, and Agriculture and
               Fisheries. Britain will be there as a full member of each one, but I believe in an EU
               with the flexibility of a network, not the rigidity of a bloc. We are not in the
               Schengen no-borders agreement, and neither should we be, because it is right that we
               use our natural advantage as an island to protect ourselves against illegal
               immigration, guns and drugs; we are not in the single currency, and while I am Prime
               Minister we will never join; we are not in the new euro area bail-out funds, even
               though we had to negotiate our way out of them; and we are not in this years
               euro-plus pact.</seg>
            <seg>When the euro was created, the previous Government agreed that there would need to
               be separate meetings of eurozone Ministers, and it is hardly surprising that those
               countries required by treaty to join the euro chose to join the existing eurozone
               members in developing future arrangements for the eurozone. Those countries are going
               to be negotiating a treaty that passes unprecedented powers from their nation states
               to Brussels. Some will have budgets effectively checked and re-written by the
               European Commission. None of this will happen in Britain. But, just as we wanted
               safeguards for Britains interests if we changed the EU treaty, we will continue to be
               vigilant in protecting our national interests.</seg>
            <seg>An intergovernmental treaty, while it does not carry with it the same dangers for
               Britain, is none the less not without risks. The decision of the new eurozone-led
               arrangement is a discussion that is just beginning. We want the new treaty to work in
               stabilising the euro and putting it on a firm foundation. I understand why they would
               want to use EU institutionsbut this is new territory and does raise important issues
               that we will want to explore with the euro-plus countries. So in the months to come
               we will be vigorously engaged in the debate about how institutions built for 27
               should continue to operate fairly for all member states, Britain included. The UK is
               supportive of the role of the institutions, not least because of the role they play
               in safeguarding the single market, so we will look constructively at any proposals
               with an open mind. But let us be clear about one thing: if Britain had agreed treaty
               change without safeguards, there would be no discussion. Britain would not have
               proper protection.</seg>
            <seg>Finally, let me turn to the next steps. The most pressing step of all is to fix the
               problems of the euro. As I have said, that involves far more than simply medium-term
               fiscal integration, important though that is. Above all, the eurozone needs to focus,
               at the very least, on implementing its October agreement. The markets want to be
               assured that the eurozone firewall is big enough, that Europes banks are being
               adequately recapitalised, and that problems in countries like Greece have been
               properly dealt with. There was some progress at the Council, but far more needs to be
               done. The eurozone countries noted the possibility of additional IMF assistance. Our
               position on IMF resources remains the one I set out at the Cannes G20 summit.
               Alongside non-European G20 countries, we are ready to look positively at
               strengthening the IMFs capacity to help countries in difficulty across the world. But
               IMF resources are for countries, not currencies, and cannot be used specifically to
               support the euroand we would not support that. There also needs to be greater
               competitiveness between the countries of the eurozone. To be frank, the whole of
               Europe needs to become more competitive. That is the way to more jobs and growth.
               Many eurozone countries have substantial trade deficits as well as budget deficits.
               If they are not to be reliant on massive transfers of capital, they need to become
               more competitive and trade out of those deficits. The British agenda has always been
               about improving Europes competitiveness, and at recent Councils we have achieved
               substantial progress on completing the single market in services, opening up our
               energy markets, and exempting micro-businesses from future regulations. This has been
               done by working in partnership with a combination of countries that are in the
               eurozone and outside it. Similarly, on this years EU budget, it was Britain, in
               partnership with France, Germany and Holland, that successfully insisted on no real
               increases in resourcesfor the first time in many, many years in the EU.</seg>
            <seg>On defence, Britain is an absolutely key European player, whether leading the NATO
               rapid reaction force or tackling piracy in the Indian ocean. Our partnership with
               France</seg>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>Thank you, Mr Speaker. Our partnership with France was crucial in taking successful
               action in Libya. Britain will continue to form alliances on the things we want to get
               done. We have always had a leading role in advocating the policy of enlargement and,
               at this Council, we all celebrated the signing of Croatias accession treaty. That was
               one European treaty I was happy to sign. Let me conclude with this point. I do not
               believe there is a binary choice for Britain: that we can either sacrifice the
               national interest on issue after issue or lose our influence at the heart of Europes
               decision-making processes. I am absolutely clear that it is possible to be a full,
               committed and influential member of the European Union but to stay out of
               arrangements where they do not protect our interests. That is what I have done at
               this Council. That is what I will continue to do as long as I am Prime Minister. It
               is the right course for this country. I commend this statement to the House.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#MILIBAND-EDWARD">
            <seg>May I start by thanking the Prime Minister for his statement? We all note the
               absence of the Deputy Prime Minister from his normal place. The reality is this: the
               Prime Minister has given up our seat at the table; he has exposed, not protected,
               British business; and he has come back with a bad deal for Britain. The Prime
               Minister told us that his first priority at the summit was to sort out the eurozone,
               but the euro crisis is not resolved. There is no promise by the European Central Bank
               to be the lender of last resort, there is no plan for growth and there is little
               progress on bank recapitalisation. Will he first tell us why his promise of action
               did not materialise and what that will mean for the British economy in the months
               ahead? At the summit that was meant to solve these problems, the Prime Minister
               walked away from the table.</seg>
            <seg>Let me turn to where that leaves Britain. Many people feared an outcome of 17
               countries going it alone. Few could have anticipated the diplomatic disaster of 26
               going ahead and one countryBritainbeing left behind. The Prime Minister rests his
               whole case on the fact that 26 countries will not be able to use the existing
               treaties or institutions. That is apparently the win that he got for this country.
               However, can he confirm that article 273 of the treaty on the functioning of the
               European Union allows those countries to use the European Court of Justice? No doubt
               they will end up using the Commissions services and, yes, even the buildingsthe point
               that he made in the negotiations. In case anyone had any doubt, that was confirmed
               yesterday by the absent Deputy Prime Minister, who said: <quote>"Well it clearly
                  would be ludicrous for the 26, which is pretty well the whole of the European
                  Unionto completely reinventa whole panoply of new institutions."</quote>

            <seg>The Prime Minister will not even be sent the agenda for the meetings that will
               start in January. He will read about decisions affecting British business in the
               pages of theFinancial Times. The Prime Ministers next claim was that he did not want
               to sign up to the fiscal rules being imposed on euro area countries. Can he confirm
               that no one even proposed that those would have applied to Britain? The next claim in
               his statement was that he did what he did because the treaty posed a grave threat to
               our financial services industry. However, over the whole course of the weekend, he
               has been unable to point to a single proposal in the proposed treaty that would
               entail the alleged destruction of the City of London. Will he tell us what the threat
               was?</seg>
            <seg>In any case, there is nothing worse for protecting our interests in financial
               services than the outcome that the Prime Minister ended up with. Will he confirm that
               he has not secured one extra protection for financial services? The veto on financial
               services regulationhe did not get it. The guarantees on the location of the European
               Banking Authorityhe did not get them. Far from protecting our interests, he has left
               us without a voice. The sensible members of his party understand that as well as

               the rest of British business, which the Prime Minister does not seem to have been
               thinking about? The danger is that the discussions about the single market, on which
               it relies, will now take place without us. Only this Prime Minister could call that
               leadership.</seg>
            <seg>The Deputy Prime Minister clearly does not agree with him. He said that the outcome
               leaves Britain isolated and marginalised. Does the Prime Minister agree with that
               assessment? How can he expect to persuade anybody else that it is a good outcome when
               he cannot persuade his own deputy?</seg>
            <seg>The Prime Minister claims to have wielded a veto. Let me explain to him that a veto
               is supposed to stop something happening. It is not a veto when the thing that you

               alliances for them suggest someone who did not exactly want a deal. Can he confirm

               have changed 25 years of the single market, why did he make them in the final hours
               of the summit? Where were the Prime Ministers allies? If he wanted a deal, why did he
               fail to build alliances with the Swedes, the Dutch, the Poles and Britains
               traditional supporters? If he really did want to protect the single market and
               financial services, why did he not seek guarantees that those issues would be
               discussed only with all 27 members in the room?</seg>

               Other countries have carried on negotiating and carried on fighting for their
               national interest. The real answer is this: he did not want a deal, because he could
               not deliver it through his party. He responded to the biggest rebellion of his party
               in Europe in a generation by making the biggest mistake of Britain in Europe for a
               generation. So this is a bad deal, which we ended up with for bad reasons, and it
               will have long-lasting consequences. It is a decision that means we are on the
               sidelines, not just for one summit but for the years ahead. The Prime Minister said
               in this House on 24 October that what mattered <quote>"is not only access to that
                  single market but the need to ensure that we are sitting around the

               could not tell us whether he is for it or against it. Has it got enough safeguards in
               it, or has it got too few safeguards? Would a Labour Government back it, or would
               they veto it? Let me tell him: if you cannot decide, you cannot lead. Inasmuch as
               there were some specific questions, let me try to answer them. The right hon.
               Gentleman asks what the threat was to financial services. Why cannot he understand
               that if you allowed a new treaty of 17 members within the EU, without proper
               safeguards, huge damage could be done to the single market and to financial services?

               going to take any lessons from people who gave in time after time to the comfy
               consensus rather than ever stand up for Britain. Just look at the record: the
               previous Government joined a bail-out scheme even though it was not protecting a
               currency that they were a member of; they gave up the rebate even though they got
               nothing in terms of the reform of agriculture; and they signed up to the Lisbon
               treaty but never had the courage to put it to the British people. Every time, they
               just go along with what others want. The Leader of the Opposition also talked about
               growth and jobs. Let me just say this: his plan, alone in Europe, is to spend more,
               borrow more and increase debt by more. All the while, if he wants to join the euro,
               he needs to understand that the treaty that is being established would actually make
               that illegal. The very thing he wants to do in Britain he wants to ban in Brussels.
               But the key question the right hon. Gentleman cannot answer is this: does he back
               this treaty or not? If the answer is yes, he should have the courage to say so. If

               been far more dangerous than a treaty outside the EU. Let me repeat this point: a

               responsible for 1 of every 9 collected in tax, and 3% of our trade surplus. It is a
               hugely important industry. There would be a threat if there were a treaty of the 17

               the British people first. That, for me, in a parliamentary democracy, is the right
