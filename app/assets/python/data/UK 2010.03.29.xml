            <seg>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the European
               Council held in Brussels last Thursday and Friday. First, I am sure that the whole
               House will join me in paying tribute to Lance Corporal of Horse Jonathan Woodgate
               from the Household Cavalry Regiment and Rifleman Daniel Holkham from 3rd Battalion
               the Rifles. They lost their lives fighting in Afghanistan. We owe them the greatest
               debt of gratitude for their courage and their service.</seg>
            <seg>Their sacrifice reminds us that terrorism is an ever-present danger which requires
               vigilance and the willingness to take tough action in all areas where terrorist
               groups operate. So I know also that the thoughts of the House-and indeed our
               country-are with the Russian people today after this morning's terrorist attack on
               the Moscow transport network. I have written to President Medvedev this morning to
               send our condolences to the victims and their families. I pay tribute to the Russian
               emergency services and the people of Moscow as they have responded to this appalling
               attack. The focus of the European Council last Thursday and Friday was on actions
               needed to secure growth for the future and on Europe's determination to bring new
               impetus and momentum to the international negotiations on climate change. Last week's
               Budget set out our proposals for the next stage of economic recovery. It made it
               clear that the risks to recovery remain real and that we must avoid a premature
               withdrawal of stimulus measures, instead seeing through our commitment to halving the
               deficit over four years without choking off the recovery itself. The European Council
               agreed that <quote>"The economic situation is improving, but the recovery is still
                  fragile".</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>It concluded that while deficit reduction plans must go ahead, measures to reduce
               the stimulus should be taken only once recovery is secured. That is the position that
               we, like our European partners, will continue to follow. In our Budget, we also set
               out the actions that we must now take to secure jobs and growth by investing in the
               key growth sectors for the future. The Council's conclusions agreed that Europe needs
                  <quote>"to deliver more growth and jobs"</quote> to boost European competitiveness
               and productivity. Before the financial crisis, the imbalances within Europe were at
               an all-time high. The Council agreed that <quote>"The EU needs to focus on the
                  pressing challenges of competitiveness and balance of payments
                  developments".</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>It also agreed to develop a new strategy to deliver higher levels of long-term
               growth and recognised that the key elements of increasing productivity and growth
               include action on employment, on research and development, on reducing greenhouse
               gases to boost low-carbon industries and on education and social inclusion. The
               European Council will now, once a year through a leaders' annual economic summit,
               assess the progress achieved at both national and European level in delivering those
               objectives. The Council also discussed the economic situation in Greece. Agreement
               has now been reached by the euro area member states on a set of guidelines for
               Greece, and I am encouraged by the statement from the eurozone leaders that the
               eurozone will meet its responsibilities. There was no request for the United Kingdom
               to make any contribution to that programme, and none of the arrangements agreed by
               the European Council will see any powers being ceded from Britain to the European
               Union.</seg>
            <seg>One year on from the G20 summit in London, we also discussed Europe's plans for the
               next G20 summit, which is to be held in Toronto. The Council agreed that
                  <quote>"rapid progress"</quote> is now required on strengthening financial
               regulation and supervision within both the EU and the G20, while we also need to
               ensure a level playing field for financial centres worldwide. In particular, we
               agreed that progress is needed on the issues of capital requirements, systemic
               institutions, financial instruments for crisis management, transparency on derivative
               markets and the implementation of internationally agreed principles for bonuses in
               the financial services sector. The Council agreed to make rapid progress on those
               issues, concluding work on the new European supervisory framework in time for the
               European systemic risk board and the three European supervisory authorities to begin
               work in early 2011. We must also agree in Toronto a co-ordinated approach to levies
               on the banks to deliver a fairer balance of risk and reward in the financial system.
               That is something that I have been advocating for some months, and the Council agreed
               that as part of the G20's work: <quote>"The Commission will shortly present a report
                  on possible innovative sources of financing such as a global levy on financial
                  transactions...The Council and the Commission will report back on these issues to
                  the June 2010 European Council, ahead of the Toronto summit."</quote>
            </seg>
            <seg>The Council also discussed climate change, ahead of the first meeting of the
               advisory group on climate change financing, established by the United Nations
               Secretary-General, which I am co-chairing with Prime Minister Meles of Ethiopia. Our
               pledge on climate change finance is a vital first test of the commitment of the
               developed countries to meeting the promises made in Copenhagen. The Council concluded
               that Europe would rapidly and unconditionally implement its commitment to providing
               2.4 billion annually for fast-track financing for developing countries, and to that
               end the EU <quote>"will initiate consultations on practical ways"</quote> to
               implement that in specific areas. There will be a presentation on those commitments
               at the Bonn summit. The Council confirmed that Europe's objective remains a
                  <quote>"global and comprehensive legal agreement"</quote> and that Europe will
                  <quote>"strengthen its outreach"</quote> to other countries to galvanise
               negotiations in the coming months.</seg>
            <seg>The euro area's economic growth is predicted to be just 0.7 per cent. this year and
               next, recovering to 1.5 per cent. in later years. By contrast, world growth is
               projected to be 3.5 per cent, so we need stronger European growth to help deliver
               stronger growth and new jobs here in Britain. Europe is the world's largest trading
               bloc and also the world's largest internal market. It offers 500 million consumers
               for British companies. With 3 million UK jobs linked to the EU, and still more than
               half our exports going to the EU, Britain's livelihood is inextricably linked to the
               success of the European economy. Distancing ourselves from Europe makes no sense and
               would hold back our economy, our companies and people in work. It is by working with,
               not against, our European partners to deliver jobs and growth for Europe that we will
               help to deliver jobs and growth for Britain. I commend this statement to the
               House.</seg>

         <u who="#CAMERON">
            <seg>I join the Prime Minister in paying tribute to Rifleman Daniel Holkham and Lance
               Corporal of Horse Jonathan Woodgate, who have been killed in Afghanistan in the past
               few days. When one thinks of what Jonathan Woodgate had already been through, it is a
               reminder of what an exceptionally brave young man he was. It also reminds us that
               what we ask of our servicemen and women today is exceptional; we need to refresh and
               renew the military covenant in every way that we can. I also agree with the Prime
               Minister that we should send a clear message of sympathy and solidarity to the
               Russian people after the appalling outrage on the Russian metro. We are tragically
               familiar with such an event in this country, too. I want to ask about three issues
               that were discussed at the summit-the EU economy, financial regulation and climate
               change. First, on climate change, the summit rightly said that we must redouble our
               efforts to achieve the global deal that we all want and push ahead with practical
               action to cut emissions. The UK has the lowest contribution from renewable energy of
               any major EU country-just 6.8 per cent. of our electricity and, in total, 2.5 per
               cent. of our energy comes from renewable sources. Why has so little progress been
               made?</seg>
            <seg>Secondly, on financial regulation, President Obama spoke about a tax on wholesale
               funding, but, as the Prime Minister has said, the summit conclusions referred to a
               transaction tax. Would not a tax on wholesale funding rather than a transaction tax
               be more likely to help keep business here in Britain? The summit conclusions mention
               the need for greater economic co-ordination. There was some controversy about whether
               we will end up with any new treaty changes. Should not the Prime Minister make three
               things clear today? First, any talk of <quote>"economic government"</quote> in Europe
               is wrong. If he agrees, can he explain why the phrase remains in the French version
               of the eurozone statement? Secondly, should we not rule out any new treaty change
               that increases EU control over our economic policies? Thirdly, should we not change
               the law in the UK so that any treaty that proposed handing over new areas of power
               from Britain to Brussels would automatically be subject to a referendum, as is the
               case in Ireland?</seg>
            <seg>It is good to see the Prime Minister smiling so nicely, as he does on all our
               posters-it is good to see him in that sort of positive mood. There are plenty more
               where they came from.</seg>
            <incident>
               <desc>Interruption</desc>
            </incident>
            <seg>If he will not put himself on posters, we have just got to do it for him. On
               economic policy, does the Prime Minister agree with the Europe 2020 strategy
               document, which says that <quote>"sound public finances are critical for restoring
                  the conditions for sustainable growth and jobs"</quote>? Given that, will he
               comment on the serious news today that Standard and Poor's has stated yet again that
               the outlook for Britain's triple-A credit rating remains <quote>"negative"</quote>
               and that <quote>"additional spending measures will likely be required"</quote> to
               tackle the debt burden?</seg>
            <seg>Europe's leaders talked about a bail-out for Greece, and Portugal's credit rating
               is being downgraded. However, is not Britain borrowing more this year as a share of
               our economy than either Greece or Portugal? Did not the same agency that downgraded
               Portugal's credit rating say last week that Britain's finances are
                  <quote>"vulnerable"</quote>? The European Commission says that <quote>"a number of
                  countries"</quote> may have to start tackling their deficits this year. Given that
               Britain and Ireland have the worst budget deficits in the OECD, to which countries
               does the Prime Minister think it was referring? On unemployment, business closures
               and the decline of manufacturing, the UK clearly has some real problems. Why,
               therefore, does he propose to raise taxes on small businesses and hike national
               insurance on everyone earning more than 20,000 and on every single new job in this
               country? The Chancellor admitted in the Budget that there was 11 billion of waste in
               Government spending, but he proposes to do nothing about it until 2011. Why is not he
               tackling the waste this year rather than putting up national insurance for
               hard-working people next year? Have not the Prime Minister and his Chancellor created
               one of those great dividing lines that they like so much? Labour stands for waste and
               taxes, and the Conservative party stands for efficiency and aspiration. As the Prime
               Minister contemplates his national insurance increase on employees and employers,
               what on earth makes him think that the way to rescue an economy from the longest and
               deepest recession on record is a tax on jobs that hits every single business in the
               country? <incident>
                  <desc>Interruption</desc>
               </incident> He says that he wants to talk about Europe - I am talking about our
               economy in Europe and our failure in Europe.</seg>
            <seg>The Prime Minister used to go to European meetings to lecture others about their
               economic policies; now the reverse happens. He thought boom and bust had been
               abolished and that he could borrow with impunity; he never prepared for a rainy day.
               Were not those catastrophic misjudgments? Will not the British people be paying for
               those misjudgments for another generation? Is not his latest misjudgement to sit back
               and let the waste, the taxes and the debt pile up even more? Is it not the case that
               we need a Government who will get on with tackling the waste, stopping the tax rises
               and securing growth for the future?</seg>

         <u who="#BROWN">
            <seg>First, let me share with the right hon. Gentleman our sympathies, as I mentioned
               earlier, for those families whose loved ones have died in Afghanistan, and our
               sympathies for the Russian people as they face a terrorist incident of very
               substantial proportions today. Let me also agree with the right hon. Gentleman that
               climate change is an important issue that Europe and the rest of the world must
               continue to address, that we must move forward on the Copenhagen summit, and that we
               must get a worldwide framework for a climate change agreement. He asks that
               renewables should be at a higher level in this country, and I agree with him that we
               should have higher investment in renewables. That is why we are making plans for
               public investment in renewables at the same time as the Conservatives oppose them. If
               I may say so, that is why we are asking councils to approve wind farms, while just
               about every Conservative council is trying to hold back that policy.</seg>
            <seg>The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the issue of a levy on financial transactions,
               which is something that we have been proposing for some time. Originally, the
               Conservatives opposed it; then they said they would support if it was at a
               multilateral level; then they said they would support it even if it was not done
               multilaterally; and then they retreated into saying that they would support it if it
               was multilateral. That is about a policy a day, but it is the same policy that is
               being reinterpreted every day. That is the reason that people have very little trust
               in Conservative economic policy. I come now to the European Council discussions on
               the economy. I just have to say this: why does the Conservative party want to attack
               the European Union all the time? Three million jobs depend on our European
               membership, more than 50 per cent. of our trade depends on Europe, and 750,000
               companies depend on Europe, so why does the right hon. Gentleman want to go to the
               European Council-if ever he were elected-to say that he wants to renegotiate our
               treaties in respect of membership of the European Union? Why does he want to
               repatriate the social chapter and employment legislation to Britain? Why does he
               threaten that he is going to have a sovereignty Act for this Parliament to suggest
               that the law affecting the European Union could somehow be modified and amended by
               doing so? Why does he resist the European advice that we should work together so that
               we do not put the recovery at risk?</seg>
            <seg>The announcement by the Conservative party today was first to withdraw 7.5 billion
               from the economy this year-</seg>

            <seg>The right hon. Gentleman says that it is good to hear that, but he also wants to
               withdraw the support that is necessary for the economy to have a sustained recovery.
               The first thing that the Conservatives have done today is make it more difficult for
               us to retain the jobs, businesses and industrial infrastructure that are necessary,
               despite the fact that every bit of advice that we are getting-and that he is
               getting-is that we must maintain the investment necessary for recovery. The
               Conservatives must explain why, at a time when people are worried about the recovery,
               they wish to withdraw support for the recovery. The second thing that they have got
               to explain is their panic measure today on national insurance</seg>

               recovery; the Conservative party policy, I am afraid, would put that recovery at
               risk. Then the Conservatives are going to spend nearly 30 billion on tax cuts in the
               next five years, which puts front-line public services at risk. People will
               understand that these panic measures by the Conservatives will not help a recovery,

               Moscow.</seg>
            <seg>I thank the Prime Minister for his report from the European Council. It will most
               probably be his last European Union summit. I imagine that he will be feeling some
               relief about that, given that in a few short years he has gone from lecturing his
               colleagues in Europe on how not to run an economy to teaching them how not to run an
               economy by example. At last week's summit, the Prime Minister called in some of the
               few favours he has left from his colleagues in Europe to delay a decision on the
               alternative investment fund managers directive. Instead of defensively trying to
               stave off damage to the City, why did he not take the chance to show real leadership
               on the reform of our banking system? Real leadership is breaking up the banks. Real
               leadership is imposing an additional levy on their profits until that is done. Real
               leadership is getting banks lending to small, viable companies that are going to the
               wall.</seg>
            <seg>Will the Prime Minister report on any conversations that he had with President
               Barroso, the President of the European Commission, as this summit was after all their
               first meeting since the Commission issued its damning verdict on the Prime Minister's
               handling of Britain's huge budget deficit? No doubt the European Commission will
               today be equally dismayed by the shiny promises of tax cuts from the shadow
               Chancellor, who is not in his place-he must be preparing for the mauling that he will
               get on television tonight. He has no idea how he will pay for those tax cuts. Labour
               and the Conservatives seem to be competing to come up with the most ludicrous fantasy
               announcement paid for with bags of gold found through efficiency savings. I am not
               sure who is winning, but I am certain that no one is falling for it.</seg>
            <seg>On the bail-out for the Greek Government, as the Prime Minister knows, instability
               in the eurozone can and will rapidly turn to instability across the European Union,
               which will affect us too. Given that, I found the lack of details about the potential
               Greek bail-out a little concerning. Yes, Greece has not yet formally asked for help,
               but we have a deal on the table that is meant to calm the markets' nerves but gives
