         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall make a statement on the European Council that
               took place in Copenhagen on 12 and 13 December. Negotiations were successfully
               concluded to admit to membership 10 countries from eastern and central Europe, and
               Cyprus and Malta. We hope that Romania and Bulgaria will be ready to follow in 2007.
               Today, we take it for granted that the 10 countries are all democratic nations living
               by the same values as the rest of Europe, but for anyone who remembers the Hungarian
               uprising of 1956, the Prague spring of 1968 or the imposition of military rule in
               Poland in 1981, the transformation of those countries from tyranny to democracy and
               now to full European Union membership is a huge achievement of which Europe and
               Britain can be justly proud. We have long been the champions of European enlargement.
               The negotiations for membership began during the British presidency of the EU in
               1998, and I should like to pay tribute particularly to the Danish presidency and the
               Commission, which brought the negotiations to a successful conclusion. Details of the
               final package are annexed to the conclusions of the meeting. Membership will bring
               immediate economic benefits to the candidates. It will create a single market of 450
               million people. Our trade has increased nearly 10 times as fast with those new
               countries as with the rest of the world, and 14,000 UK firms now export to east and
               central Europe. Membership of the EU will boost the gross domestic product of those
               countries by nearly 1.5 per cent., and our own by up to nearly #2 billion. The new
               member states are countries that have only recently rediscovered their national
               identity. They, like us, will want the further integration of the Union to be firmly
               rooted in the democratic accountability of the nation state. They shall be our allies
               in developing a European Union on those lines. For some time, Turkey has been
               knocking on the door of the European Union. The response of the Union has rightly
               been to encourage a closer economic and political relationship, but to say that full
               membership would be possible only when Turkey met the necessary human rights
               criteria. In the past year, Turkey has made enormous strides by abolishing the death
               penalty and adopting a range of human rights laws. The new Turkish Government have
               promised a detailed legislative timetable to accelerate that progress. I believe that
               it is massively in our interests to see Turkey as a modern democratic partner in
               Europe. For that reason, I have been urging our partners to offer Turkey a date to
               open negotiations for membership, provided that the so-called Copenhagen criteria are
               met. I am pleased to report to the House that that was achieved in Copenhagen. The
               Commission will report on Turkey's progress and if, in December 2004, on a
               recommendation from the Commission, the European Council decides that Turkey fulfils
               the Copenhagen political criteria, accession negotiations with Turkey will open
               without delay. That agreement has contributed to a better climate on the
               long-standing Cyprus dispute. The Secretary-General of the United Nations and his
               special representative, Mr. De Soto, have been tireless in their efforts, as has our
               own special representative, Lord Hannay. A settlement remains within reach. I urge
               all parties to continue their efforts to find a comprehensive settlement, which would
               allow a reunited Cyprus to join the European Union, as set out in the conclusions of
               the European Council. We were also able to resolve differences between Turkey and
               Greece that have delayed the agreement between the European Union and NATO necessary
               to allow the implementation of a European security and defence policy. We have now
               established the essential linkage with NATO, which means that where NATO is not
               involved the European Union can undertake peacekeeping operations using NATO
               planning, with the option of using NATO headquarters and NATO assets as well. As a
               result, the European Union stands ready to take over the military operation in
               Macedonia, in consultation with NATO, and to lead a military operation in Bosnia
               following SFOR. The European Council issued a declaration on the middle east in
               advance of the Quartet ministerial meeting in Washington. The Quartet brings together
               the European Union, the United States, Russia and the United Nations, and its meeting
               on 20 December will take us a further step forward. In the short term, progress on
               the Israeli side will be limited by the general election campaign in Israel. However,
               I believe that we should use the intervening period to maximise the chances of
               successful implementation of the road map once a new Israeli Government are in place.
               That means continuing to do what we can to secure an end to violence, and to reverse
               the deteriorating humanitarian situation. It also means ensuring that Palestinian
               reform is effective. To that end, I can announce today that I am inviting leading
               Palestinians to come to Britain in January for a conference, along with members of
               the Quartet and other countries from the region closely involved in supporting the
               reform effort. The participants will discuss progress on reform and consider how the
               international community can help. It is in the interests of Palestinians and Israelis
               that the reform efforts succeed, so that we can make a reality of President Bush's
               vision of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and
               security. The European Council also issued a declaration on Iraq, giving its full and
               unequivocal support for Security Council resolution 1441 and urging Iraq to seize
               this final opportunity to comply with its international obligations. Finally, we
               speak against the background of serious problems confronting our fishing industry. In
               the past 30 years, cod stocks in the North sea have fallen from 250,000 tonnes to
               35,000 tonnes. If fishing continues at the present rate there is a risk of there
               being no viable cod fishing industry left. That is why the European Commission has
               suggested a reduction in fishing of 80 per cent., to enable the cod stock to recover
               to its absolute minimum viable level. Scientists believe that the safe minimum is
               150,000 tonnes. We share the objective of enabling fish stocks to recover, but we
               believe that much more moderate measures could deliver recovery while maintaining a
               viable industry. I have talked extensively both with the President of the Commission
               at Copenhagen and with Commissioner Fischler previously. Fisheries Ministers are now
               meeting in Brussels to reach agreement on the issue. The UK fishing industry has
               benefited over the past year from #36 million of funding to support adjustment
               through decommissioning. This includes the Scottish Executive's action to help
               preserve fish stocks and ensure the industry's long-term viability with a #27 million
               aid package. If there are further cuts arising from the ongoing negotiations in
               Brussels, the UK Government and the Scottish Executive stand ready to help the
               fishing communities affected. I will meet leaders of the industry in the new year,
               and financial assistance will be made available if necessary, but the priority for
               now must be to get a fair deal for our fishing industry. The summit was a remarkable
               achievement. It redefines the future shape of Europe. It describes a future in which
               Europe is reunited, a Europe of proud and sovereign nation states, working together
               economically, socially and politically in their common interest. The prospect of
               Turkey's membership has even more dramatic implications. A nation that borders the
               Arab world, that is Muslim, that is none the less striking out on a path leading to
               liberal democracy, is set in time to join the traditional nations of Europe. The
               implications for the future of Europe are profound. In time, all these new countries
               will be part of the European economy, part of monetary union, part of European
               defence, part of the European political system. For us in Britain, the implications
               are equally profound. It is our job to be part of the new Europe that is developing,
               to be a leading power within it and to understand the degree to which our national
               interest is bound up with it. Isolation from Europe in this new world is absolute
               folly. That is why we shall continue to fight for our interests, but recognise that
               they are best served inside the European Union, not on its margins.</seg>

         <u who="#SMITH">
            <seg>I thank the Prime Minister for his statement and join him in welcoming the
               conference that he has apparently announced today for leading Palestinian reformers,
               involving representatives of the EU, the UN, Russia and the United States. We will
               await more details on that before dealing with it in detail ourselves. This historic
               summit is a tribute to the long, hard and sometimes lonely battles fought by
               successive British Governments to extend the benefits of EU membership to the former
               communist states of central and eastern Europe. Like the Prime Minister, I, too,
               congratulate the Danish presidency and in particular Prime Minister Rasmussen, who
               has been a diligent and honest broker for a working settlement on enlargement.
               However, I think that I speak for many on both sides of the House, as well as for
               millions elsewhere in Europe, when I express my regret at how long enlargement has
               taken. As the Prime Minister knows, for all British Governments it is 13 years since
               the Berlin wall came down: 13 years of excluding central and eastern European
               countries from western European markets, all because Brussels insisted on full
               compliance with social legislation. Only now has the EU lived up to its obligations;
               as I have said, it was successive British Governments who tried to lead the way.
               Enlargement may be the European Union's finest hour, but its delay reveals the vested
               interests in parts of the EU with which we have become all too familiar. The
               Copenhagen summit showed a side to the Franco-German axis with which the Prime
               Minister is also becoming all too familiar. Back in October in Brussels, he was
               outflanked by France and Germany when they delayed common agricultural policy
               reform—a move that will greatly increase the cost of EU membership to accession
               states and to existing member states alike. Last week in Copenhagen, he was again
               outflanked —</seg>

         <u who="#SMITH">
            <seg>Last week in Copenhagen, the Prime Minister was again outflanked by France and
               Germany over membership negotiations for Turkey. The Turks wanted them to start
               before the current round of enlargement was implemented, and they were supported not
               just by the UK Government, but by the Spanish, the Italians and even the Greeks. Yet,
               once again, France and Germany prevailed. Negotiations have been delayed until
               December 2004—well after enlargement will have been completed. Does the Prime
               Minister agree that those actions by France and Germany have been to the detriment of
               the European Union? Does he also agree that it is imperative that we encourage
               Turkey, as a NATO ally and as a secular, democratic Muslim nation, to play a full
               role in the European Union at the earliest possible opportunity? We are constantly
               urging the benefits of democracy on the Islamic world, yet here is the EU telling
               Turkey that she must prove her intentions all over again. Does not the Prime Minister
               think that direct negotiations would provide the strongest possible incentive for
               Turkey to meet the highest standards on human rights? Does he also agree that
               negotiations would provide the ideal opportunity to ensure that Cyprus—now to be an
               EU member itself—became a united island again? Was not the decision to delay these
               negotiations a snub for the Government of Turkey and for all those nations that
               supported her? The Prime Minister says that the Euro army has reached an agreement
               with NATO that will allow it to use the alliance's planning, assets and headquarters.
               This, he said, means that the Euro army Xstands ready" to take over military
               operations in Macedonia. Is that not in fact an admission that the Euro army should
               have been inside NATO all along? Now we have the rather ridiculous sight of the Prime
               Minister pretending that the EU has no military competence other than NATO deciding
               what it will or will not do. Surely the Government's position on this throughout has
               been seen for what it is—baseless and solely part of a wider negotiation with France.
               Last week I wrote to the Prime Minister asking him to raise the severe proposed cuts
               to British fishing quotas. There was not one word about the common fisheries policy
               in the presidency's conclusions. That seems strange, given that before Copenhagen the
               Prime Minister wrote that Scottish fishermen would have the Government's full backing
               Xright to the very top". According to today's statement, that amounted to the Prime
               Minister holding a conversation with Romano Prodi on the margins of the Copenhagen
               summit. With 40,000 jobs at stake on the basis of a contested scientific report,
               Britain's fishing community surely deserves better than just a conversation. Instead,
               it seems that the Government fully accepted that further savage cuts would be
               necessary. Why did the Prime Minister not force discussion of the fundamental issues
               of the CFP on to the table, as would have been required? It seems doubly strange that
               the conclusions refer to Spanish fishermen and Portuguese farmers, whose concerns
               were raised and registered at the same summit, whereas our fishermen have been left
               out. The Prime Minister is right: this ought to have been a truly historic moment for
               our continent, when the cold war divisions were replaced with a new European
               settlement on prosperity, stability and mutual co-operation. Instead, all too often,
               the EU élites, to which he never refers, are bent on creating some sort of
               superpower. The common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy, which the
               Prime Minister simply fails to sort out, are left unreformed as part of wider
               discussions. The forces of old Europe seem reluctant to let go: making them do so
               will take more than the Prime Minister talking tough before meetings and backing down
               after he has been there.</seg>

            <seg> Where does one begin, Mr. Speaker? First, for the right hon. Gentleman to say that

               have managed to get 10 countries into the European Union.</seg>

         <u who="#ANCRAM">
            <seg>My right hon. Friend welcomed it.</seg>
         </u>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>If I may say so, it was a slightly grudging welcome. Given the interests at stake,
               it is a remarkable tribute to the vitality of the European Union that these countries
               have been accepted. The Leader of the Opposition had to make this attack because at
               the very time when a large part of the Conservative party is queueing up to get out,
               this other lot is queueing up to get in. As for what the right hon. Gentleman said
               about Turkey, what happened was not to do with the French and German objections. It
               is correct that Britain, Italy, Spain and probably Greece would have gone further,
               but many countries were deeply hesitant about whether Turkey could fulfil the
               criteria. The key was to get a date, and we have got a date. It could have been a few
               months earlier, but it is, again, a tremendous step forward in Europe's relations
               with Turkey. Although I am a huge supporter of Turkey's membership of the European
               Union, there are issues to do with human rights that must be addressed. It is
               important that we address them and that Turkey's new leadership, who are really
               trying to address the issues, are given time to do so properly. It is churlish to
               suggest that the European Union was snubbing us or snubbing Turkey. Given where we
               were, it is a big step forward. On European defence, the whole point about Macedonia
               is that NATO does not wish to be involved. That is why it is sensible for European
               defence, using the full support of NATO, to do it. The reason that it is so important
               to have European defence—but on the right basis, fully consistent with NATO—is
               precisely because there may be situations when, for whatever reason, NATO does not
               want to be involved. It is important, therefore, that Europe has the capability to do
               that for itself. The British Conservative party is against European defence, but even
               America now supports it as the right way forward for Europe and for NATO. The most
               disastrous thing that we could do in respect of the CFP would be to adopt what I
               assume is now the policy of the Conservative party and withdraw from it. That would
               give us no protection whatsoever. It would not actually stop cod stocks being fished
               before they migrate to British waters—it would not actually help our fishermen at
               all. We must recognise that there is a huge problem. We are fighting hard to get the
               best deal possible, but it is a cruel deception to pretend to the fishing industry
               either that there is not an issue or that there is some simple solution—neither is
               correct. As for the Leader of the Opposition's statement that with the Conservative
               party we should get a better deal in Europe, I do not know of a Conservative party—it
               will be interesting to see whether Opposition Members can name one—anywhere else in
               Europe, in the existing EU, in the countries that are about to join or in countries
               that may join later, that supports the completely foolish, backward and isolationist
               policy of the British Conservative party.</seg>

         <u who="#KENNEDY">
            <seg>I thank the Prime Minister for his statement and join him in congratulating the
               successful Danish presidency. Judging from the House's reaction to the remarks of the
               leader of the Conservative party, it widely shares the view that we felt no sense of
               history when the right hon. Gentleman described a time of such historic
               groundbreaking achievement for Europe and for the spread of democracy, stability,
               peace and security across the continent as 13 wasted years. I thought that that
               referred to a different period in history relating to the Conservative party. None
               the less, the 18 years of unbroken Conservative Government in this country certainly
               helped to build the single European market. It helped to extend qualified majority
               voting—thanks to Mrs. Thatcher and the Conservative party—and it even helped to pave
               the way for the enlargement process on which Conservative Members seem to be trying
               to pour cold water today. They have no sense of history and even less sense of the
               future—that is the Conservative party. Given that some of the continuing entrenched
               aspects of the common agricultural policy have become even more entrenched as a
               result of some of the decisions that were reached at the summit, what prospect does
               the Prime Minister see, with enlargement ahead of us, of achieving the genuine,
               long-term reform of the CAP that is inevitable, desirable and will come about only if
               our country plays its full part at the top table of Europe? It will not be achieved
               on the country club membership basis advocated by certain people. Would not Britain's
               hand in Europe be strengthened more generally if we showed greater political resolve
               on the single European currency? Increasingly, we risk marginalising ourselves, as
               well as suffering domestic economic disadvantage, due to continuing uncertainty about
               a referendum and about the Government's long-term political commitment on the issue.
               I welcome the decision reached about Turkey. It is important that over the next two
               years there is full and active engagement with the Turkish authorities—not least as
               regards human rights—to ensure that as and when accession negotiations with Turkey
               are held, they are based on stability and dependable understanding as regards not
               only the commitment of the Turkish democratic authorities to Europe itself, but the
               need to maintain the fundamental values of human rights that Europe enshrines and to
               which we are signatories. Does the Prime Minister agree that it does not help
               intelligent discussion of matters European in this country to speak in a completely
               misleading fashion, bandying about such shorthand terms as XEuro army"? In fact,
               there is a strategic and sensible basis on which NATO and the EU can co-operate when
               they want to do so or whereby they can pursue different or varying agendas when that
               is the most sensible course. Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that that message
               from the summit, following the most recent NATO discussions, is welcome and must be
               the sane way forward? Fisheries are a major concern to many of our communities, not
               least those in Scotland, so I welcome today's statement from the Commission that it
               wishes to defer decisions on quotas for a further three months. In his discussions
               with the leaders of the fishing representatives after the turn of the year, will the
               Prime Minister take every opportunity to carry them with him on the discussions that
               must ensue about the scientific evidence? The fact that our domestic fleet has
               already made a good contribution must be recognised in Brussels to a greater and more
               sensitive extent than it has been so far. Finally, I welcome the Palestine
               conference, which the Prime Minister has announced today, but will he underscore the
               need for Europe to be seen to be contributing to restarting the middle east peace
               process? Will he acknowledge that it would be appropriate for the Defence Secretary
               or the Foreign Secretary to make a statement before the recess about any possible
               British troop deployments vis-a-vis Iraq during the parliamentary recess?</seg>

         <u who="#BLAIR">
            <seg>I agree entirely with the right hon. Gentleman about enlargement. It is worth
               pointing out that Britain has always done best in Europe when it has been engaged.
               Although, of course, the Conservative party's history in Europe when it was in office
               has been somewhat rewritten, the fact is that Mrs. Thatcher was engaged in Europe for
               the first seven or eight years of her premiership, and the Conservatives were
               responsible for putting through the single market proposals. It is important to
               realise that, in the end, they were a lot more sensible then than they are now, and
               perhaps the same could be said of us. The key is to ensure that we carry on getting
               the best possible deal for Britain. That is also true in relation to CAP reform. The
               leader of the Conservative party was quite wrong. CAP reform was not blocked at the
               Brussels summit. Indeed, the disagreement was about over insistence that the mid-term
               review should go back into the conclusions of the Brussels summit, so the agriculture
               reform programme continues, as the Commissioner indicated a few days ago. The right
               hon. Gentleman knows that the position on the euro has not changed. I agree with what
               he says about Turkey. On the CFP, I also agree that it is important that we try to
               work out the very best deal that we can possibly secure for our fishing industry,
               recognising that there is a genuine problem. I simply say that people who complain
               that the Government are not doing enough but refuse to recognise that a fundamental
               issue has to be tackled—whoever was in government would have to tackle it—are not
               doing a service to the Scottish fishing industry because they are pretending that
               there is an easy solution when there is not one. The right hon. Gentleman is right
               about European defence. The benefit of engagement is absolutely clear. The tragedy is
               that if we were not engaged as a country in the debate about European defence, it
               would not mean that European defence would not take place; it would simply mean that
               it would take place without us.</seg>

            <seg>In respect of the latter point, it is important that we encourage Balkan countries
               to move towards the prospect of European Union membership. As the right hon.
               Gentleman implies, that is obviously some way off, and the income disparity is very
               great. In the meantime, however, the European Union has conducted agreements with
               most of those countries—in fact, probably all of them—to help them in that process.
               Again, the advantages for us are immense. This is the first period for years and
               years—other than during the appalling domination of the old Soviet bloc—when those
               countries seem to be reaching towards some sort of stability. We have got to
               encourage that. The way to do it is to help them financially, which the European
               Union is doing, and also to start, over time, to offer them a more obvious path to
               European integration.</seg>

               say that Turkey has made great strides forward, but this is still a pretty good
               timetable. It is not quite as good as we would have liked, but as people in Turkey
               reflect on it, they will see that after 40 years of trying to get a firm date, they

               reassurance that we will have objective assessment criteria, such as the Copenhagen

               political and human rights are clear, and we should follow them without fear or
               favour, treating Turkey exactly the same as any other country. It has no desire to be
               treated as a special member of the club. One of the great potential benefits of
               Turkey's membership of the EU is the notion that Europe can welcome in a nation that
               is predominantly Muslim, especially as almost all EU nations—including certainly our

            <seg>Yes, it is extremely important that we do so because there is no way Europe can

               countries with the existing rules. The only point that I would make is that people
               often see this as a battle between the Council, the intergovernmental approach, and
               the Commission, the Community approach. In fact, we need to strengthen both. We need
               a strong, independent Commission to drive through processes such as economic reform,
               but we also need a strong Council, able to handle the management of the affairs of 25
               or more nations, to give the EU a strong external voice and to set the agenda for

               not pose a great problem for us, and it is far more important to make sure that the
               enlargement process goes through in those countries. Many of them, such as Poland,

               historic vote to take us into the Common Market, we were promised economies of scale
               and that we would be able to compete with the rest? If we joined the six, we were
               told, it would be wonderful. We had the same thing with the Single European Act and
               Maastricht. When the Union was enlarged to 15, we were told we would be able to trade
               more effectively. In all that time, they have never bought a cobble of coal from
               Britain, even though it is the cheapest deep-mined coal in Europe. What reassurance
               can my right hon. Friend give me that 450 million people in the enlarged Europe will
               change their ways and buy British goods? Our manufacturing industries have been going
               to the wall throughout that period. A fortnight ago, the balance of trade deficit was
               the largest ever. At some point, that must end. All I say to my right hon. Friend is
